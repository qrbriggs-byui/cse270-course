      <h1>Creating Good Questions</h1>
      <p>There have been some issues in the past with writing questions for the quizzes, I would like to clarify some information.</p>            

		   <h3>Question Difficulty and iLearn</h3>
		   <p>iLearns 3.0 provide several different types of questions and you have seen these in the quiz and other tests you have taken in other classes or tests:
		   </p><ul>•	True/False (one correct answer or one incorrect answer)	[auto grade]</ul>
		   
<ul>•	Multiple choice (one correct answer, m-incorrect answers)	 [auto grade]</ul>
<ul>•	Multiple select  (n-correct answers, m-incorrect answers)	 [auto grade]</ul>
<ul>•	Matching (1-to-1 or n-to-1 or n-to-1+m; m-incorrect answers) [auto grade]</ul>
<ul>•	Fill in the blank 						[Limited auto grade]</ul>
<ul>•	Long-answers 						 [No auto grade]</ul>
<p>Break down of questions:</p>

<ul>•	True/False questions are the simplest type of questions.</ul>
<ul>•	Most multiple choice questions can be reduced down to a set of multiple T/F questions. Meaning if you have a multiple choice question and you don’t really know the answer, you can treat each possible choice as a T/F, where only one of them is True. NOTE: You are not allowed to have more than one throw away answer, an answer that is not related to the question, i.e.: My professor has crazy ties. </ul>
<ul>•	This hold true for Multiple-Select, except you can have a multiple answers that are true.</ul>
<ul>•	Matching says that all of the answers need to be correct, and correspond to a subset of the answers provided (1-to-1 or n-to-1 or n-to-1+m). You can have the same amount of questions as answers (1-to-1). You can have more questions, that match multiple to times to the same answers (n-to-1). Or you have several questions to match only to a subset of the answers (n-to-1+m), you provide extra answers just to through off the asker.</ul>
<p>As you can see, the difficulty and complexity of the questions increase from T/F to Matching. Fill-in-the-Blank and Long-answers are the next level of difficulty, but there is a downside for online quizzes.</p>
		   
		   <h3>Auto-Grading</h3>
<p>All of these can be auto graded. The Fill-in-the-Blank and Long-answers have to be manually graded.  I would not recommend using these as part of questions set. One you will not have an immediate score and it takes a long time for me to grade the quizzes. Please do not provide any of these, as in most cases Fill-in-the-Blank and Long-answers can be converted in to any of the auto-graded type questions</p>

		   <h3>Fact-Based Questions vs Comprehension or Reasoning</h3>
<p>I am sure you have heard that Thoughts lead to Action, and Actions lead to Habits. Where do thoughts come from?  They come from questions. Questions are smashing two ideas together. I am also sure that you know that there are good questions and not so good. The complexity of the question makes a huge difference in measurement, value and quality. Here are a few categories of complexity questions.</p>
		   
<ul><li> <b>Fact-Based Questions</b> are easy questions is it equal or not equal to the definition or situation. There is only one variable to deal with. </li>
	<ul>
	<li> <b>True/False Example</b> (Statement of fact true or false):  <i>The sun goes around the earth.</i></li>
    <li> <b> Multiple Choice/Select</b> (Definitions, Terms, ect): <i> The command, in C++, to output text to the screen is: A. output; B. cout; C. echo; D. system.out.printf</i></li>	
	<li> <b> Matching</b> (The examples here are incomplete, but the description gives you a general idea: <i> Match the terms with definitions...</i> or <i> Order the steps of the given process in the reading...</i> </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b>Comprehension questions</b> are a bit more difficult, usually having to combine or compare situations. A Comprehension questions can be like Fact-Based, but explained different ways in your own words. In a sense, one could say it comparisons or multi-variable for a given domain. 
    <ul>
		<li> <b>True/False Example</b> (Using the comparison of facts to produce a conclusion): <i> (T/F) The earth travels faster around the sun than the spin of the sun.</i> or <i> (T/F) Loops are a types of functions.</i></li>
		<li> <b>Multiple Choice/Select</b> (Comparing two different ideas, showing both the differences and similarities): <i> What is common between an if and a for loop: A. Initializing variable; B. Incrementing a variable; C. Comparison boolean; D. Executing a false code block</i></li>
		<li> <b> Matching</b> (Here everything is based on the reading): <i>Match the output of each line of code... </i> or <i>For each scenario given in the <b>reading</b>, match it with the term from the reading... </i> or <i>Order the steps in the scenario, based off the reading’s given process...</i></li>
		</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b>Reasoning questions</b> are more difficult, because they follow a set of processes or equations. Reasoning questions are showing your work, or which of the following answers would be a solution to a questions. </li>
	<ul>
		<li> <b>True/False Example</b> (Providing logic reasoning to produce a conclusion):  <i>The rotation of Mars with the rotation of Pluto, we can determine that the earths yearly rotation is shorter than Venus.</i> or <i> Functions can be use to perform looping</i></li>
		<li> <b>Multiple Choice/Select</b> (Providing possible solutions, and choosing the best one): <i> Which looping statement would be best to use if you want to guarantee that the loop is executed at least once: A. Recursive call to the same function; B. A while statement; C. A do..while statement; D. A for loop</i></li>
		<li> <b> Matching</b> (Here new ideas are compared to the reading) : <i> For each scenerio, (not from the reading), match them to the terms from the reading...</i> or <i> Order the steps of a given scenario, outside of the reading, based on the process provided by the reading...</i></li>
	</ul>
	
</ul>
<p>I know this is not a perfect comparison, but it helps illustrate the level of complexity.

<h2>		   Assigning Points</h2>
<p>The following questions are assigned point values</p>

<p> You need at least 40 pts to be considered to have three to five good questions about your topic.</p>
<p>Please send me an email with your questions. Make sure you include in the subject line: “CS 416 Week 05 Group#.” Include your three questions, and the answers. Also indicate what complexity level you think your questions are: Fact-Based, Comprehension or Reasoning, by default they will be graded as Fact-Based so provide justification.</p>
<p>Hints: You are allowed to provide hints in your slides, but not the actual questions and answers</p>

<p> Special Note: </p>
<ul>Multiple Choice with two answers is the same as T/F</ul>
<ul>Multiple Select with one answer that is true or one that is false, is the same as Multiple Choice.</ul>
<ul>Matching with only 2 possible choices is the same as Multiple Select.</ul>
