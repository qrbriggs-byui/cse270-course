	<h1>Lab 12 - Risks of <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse270-course/Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a></h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Identify different risks and mitigation solutions associated with <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse270-course/Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a> and develop tests to address and verify the management of those risks.</p>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>As with any application, there are certain issues and risks. Identify the  risks, mitigate them, and prove resolution through tests. </p>
    <h3>Identify Issue Category</h3>
    <p>With your partner, pick two of the major influences that might be affected  by <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse270-course/Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr.  Mobile</a>. </p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Medical -       insurance, services, and payments of a health civilization</li>
      <li>Government       - local, city, state, and federal government policies and laws</li>
      <li>Politics -       people, dealing with hierarchy and authority of power</li>
      <li>Academia -       schools, education and learning, and standard of living</li>
      <li>Corporations       - all domain knowledge (markets and trade) and business types (profit to       non-profit)</li>
      <li>Military -       protection of civilization</li>
      <li>Religion -       the wellbeing of civilization</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Brainstorm Issue</h3>
    <p>Pick five issues that are associated with the influences that you picked. Be  careful, and we are not necessarily talking about risks associated with the Application  but with the conflict between the Influence and the Application.<br>
      For example, if you picked Medical, </p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Not an       Issue: <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse270-course/Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr.       Mobile</a> has a bug that loses patient's data.</li>
      <li>Issue: How       will <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse270-course/Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr.       Mobile</a> keep patient information secure to follow HIPPA.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Issues can be associated with Legal, Security, Regulations, Standards, etc.</p>
    <h3>Identify the risk</h3>
    <p>For each of the Issues:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Identify       at least two different variables that might be contributing factors.       Create a two-dimension chart, identifying the two input variables,       assigning Low, Medium, or High for the crossing data points. </li>
      <li>You need       to identify the risk level of each of your issues, Low, Medium, or High. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>One way risk is measure by how often it occurs and what the severity is. </p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>If it       occurs often and is severe, it is considered high risk. </li>
      <li>If it does       occur often or is not highly severe, then it is medium risk, and </li>
      <li>If it       doesn't occur often and is not severe, then it is a low risk. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This example's scale is binary but works on different scales from 1 to 3 to  1 to 10 depending on the problem's detail. Not all risk uses these two  variables. &nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Brainstorm Mitigation</h3>
    <p>For each of your questions, identify what mitigation type would be good to  resolve the issue.</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Prevention </li>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>Prevention        mitigation is the process of putting up a defense to prevent it from        happening. This is usually in the form of a mitigation plan. For example,        to mitigate the risk of your car being stolen, you look at the doors,        have a loud security alarm, and store it in the locked garage. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Transference </li>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>Transference        typically has an insurance policy that will cover the costs that might        happen from the fall out of the risk. For example, to prevent paying for        replacing your car and having to pay others and your medical bill, you        have car insurance that lowers that payment to a manageable deductible.        &nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Acceptance </li>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>Acceptance        is holding a reserve to handle the risk, and you know it is going to        happen, and it is just part of the business. For example, you accept that        driving on the highway may cause death or injury or getting a tune-up on        the car as parts wear out. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Avoidance </li>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>Avoidance        is changing the activity, process, or policy that will not all the risk        to happen. &nbsp;For example, you avoid driving at night if you have        night vision problems or avoid driving during bad weather if your tires        are not new. </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Test for Mitigation</h3>
    <p>Identify what you could do to test that the mitigation plan you have for  each issue.</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>What would       you do to measure it?</li>
      <li>Write a       test that would identify the results.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>Post summary of the lab assignment to the discussion board.</p>
    <h2>Rubric</h2>
    <p>Use the following rubric to help understand the expectation. </p>
