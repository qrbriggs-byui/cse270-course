	<h1>Lab 04 - Determining Test Technique</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
    	<p><a href="../Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a> will contain several types of features, sensors, emitters, and capabilities. Each one of these features will need to be tested. You have learned about more than a dozen different techniques that can be used from the code level up to the system level. You will be applying that knowledge to determine which technique is best to be used for different parts of <a href="../Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a>.	</p>
   	<h2>Assignment</h2>
		<p>Read over existing posts on the Lab Discussion board. </p>
		<h3>Pick a 2 technqiues and 1 <a href="../Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a> feature</h3>
  <p>You will need to pick 2 different testing techniques and one or more features of <a href="../Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a> that have not been applied in the discussion board. If your techique was applied to a feature, you can't use that same technique for that feature. </p>
		<h3>Verification Post: </h3>
		<p>Create 2 different posts. Each post will be how <a href="../Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a> feature will be tested with that technique. Identify the Lifecycle phase that the test will be used. Briefly describe the scope of the test and why this feature &amp; technique would be important to verify. </p>
		<h3>Brainstorming Replies: </h3>
		<p>Yes, reply. Pick two of your classmates' posts. Identify either the <a href="../Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a> feature or the testing technique. If you choose the feature, identify a different technique that could be used, provide reason to how this will help with the verification. If you choose the technique, identify a different feature that could also be tested using that technique. </p>
		<p>Note: You can not use the same features or techninques you use in the Verification posts.	</p>
