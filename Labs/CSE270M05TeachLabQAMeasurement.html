	<h1>Lab 05 - Measuring Sensors</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>As a part of <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse270-course/Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a>'s  development, engineers and programmers need to know how accurate the sensors,  both internal and external, to determine the noise to signal ratio in  calibrating and detecting a change to raise event update to the software.<br>
      You will need a mobile device to complete this lab or use pre-scanned lab  data. <br>
      Depending on your phone type, you can:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Activate       the hidden hardware diagnose program. </li>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>From        Phone keypad type: *#0*#</li>
        <li>Look        up your phone type </li>
        <li>What        does it look like:<br>

      </ul>
      <li>Download a       sensor app that will show the different sensor available on your phone </li>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>Android:        Google Play: Sensor Lab or Phone Check and Test</li>
        <li>iOS:        Phone Diagnostics</li>
        <li>Both:        TestM (warning likes facebook info)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Use any       application where you can watch the sensor output. (Be creative). If you       want, you could use your laptop or computer sensors. i.e., Windows Voice       recorder.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Complete the following steps:</p>
    <h3>Observe SENSOR</h3>
    <p>Record the program that you are using for this lab.<br>
      Pick a sensor, observe the output of the device at rest. Interact with the  sensor.<br>
      Answer the following questions:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>What is it       measuring?</li>
      <li>Determine       the normal sensory?</li>
      <li>Determine       abnormal, change, or detection state? What caused it?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Create Three Scenarios</h3>
    <p>Come up with three different ways, activities, or scenarios that you would  use the sensor. For example, using the Accelerometer: Sitting, Walking,  Running, Riding). <br>
      Answer the following questions:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Determine       the measurement criteria, write them down.</li>
      <li>Write down       your prediction of what will happen during the activity.</li>
      <li>What are       some risks? What side effects could happen?</li>
      <li>What would       be considered a successful pass of your scenario? What would be an almost?       And not quite?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Test SCENARIOS</h3>
    <p>Using your observer sensor, test the device in your three scenarios. <br>
      Record the results. </p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Repeat       your scenario until you get all successes. </li>
      <li>Repeat       your scenario until you get the almost successes</li>
      <li>Repeat       your scenario for not entirely.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Answer the following questions:<br>
      Did you have to change the test, your expectation, or the  technique? </p>
    <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
    <p>Do the following:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Write an       overview of what you learned. </li>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>Include        what you used to test the sensor you are testing (What software)</li>
        <li>Include        your scenarios and how you tried it</li>
        <li>Include        what you determined was successful and what was not.</li>
        <li>Include        data or proof that you completed the test: measurements, screen captured,        etc</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Post your       write-up.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Peer Testing </h3>
    <p>Read over two of your classmates' scenario summaries. Run the tests as they  described them. <br>
      Answer the following in a reply post: </p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Did you       get the same results as your classmate? </li>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>If        you didn't, what was the difference?</li>
        <li>If        you did, what could be improved? </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Suggest       another scenario to test. Provide predictions as to the results. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>Post your summary to the discussion board.<br>
      Find two of your classmate's tests and run them. Post your results (with  data). <br>
      You will be reporting your results in your Ponder assignment. Make sure you  record your Lab points.</p>
    <h2>Rubric</h2>
    <p>Use the following rubric to help understand the expectation. </p>
