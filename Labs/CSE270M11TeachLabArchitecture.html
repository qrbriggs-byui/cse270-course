	<h1>Lab 11 - Architecture Testing</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>One of the most important aspects of any application is the architecture,  knowing where the information is being collected, processed, transferred, and  stored, typically to identify stages and states found in architecture. <br>
    Your team needs to create tests to identify where to pass data along the  different communication paths and determine the use of communication services.</p>
<h2>Assignment</h2>
  <p>For this lab, you will determine what data to pass along the different  communication paths. </p>
<h3>Communication Paths</h3>
  <p>Pick one of the following communication paths, and determine what data to  pass and what resources to use. </p>
<p></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Communication between External Device (Monitor) and <a href="../Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a>. (Peer-To-Peer).</li>
    <li>Communication between one <a href="../Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a> Device and another Device(Peer-To-Peer).</li>
    <li>Communication between Transportation and <a href="../Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a> (Wireless).</li>
    <li>Communication between Home Base and <a href="../Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a> (Client - Server).</li>
    <li>Communication between Supply Chain and <a href="../Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a>e (Rule-Based).</li>
    <li>Communication between User and <a href="../Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a> HMI(Event-Driven).</li>
    <li>Communication between <a href="../Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a> to Database (Data).</li>
  </ul>
		<h3>Workflow</h3>
        <p>Using the workflow (Lab 08) of <a href="../Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a>, identify the needed data for each  step, created during that step, and the next step's output. </p>
        <h3>Log Files</h3>
        <p>Each element of the workflow and architecture elements need to record the transition  states and data. Answer the following questions to help identify logging  information:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>What is       needed to be able to track the workflow through the entire system?</li>
          <li>What is a       normal output to the log file? To the user?</li>
          <li>What is an       error output to the log file? To the user?</li>
          <li>What is a       warning output to the log file? To the user?</li>
        </ul>
<h2> Submission</h2>
	<p>Post summary of the lab to the discussion board.</p>
