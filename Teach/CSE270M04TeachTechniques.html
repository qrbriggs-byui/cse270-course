        <h1>CSE 270: W04 Presentation: Testing Techniques</h1>
    </header>


    <article>
    <p>With your partner, create a presentation that captures your findings. For campus students, this presentation will occur during class time. This presentation will be recorded in a video and posted on a streaming service for online students.</p>
    <h2>Create a Slide Deck</h2>
    <p>Create a slide deck using whatever presentation software you like with your partner. This slide deck must contain all the information necessary to communicate your testing technique, as well as citations where the viewers can learn more about the technique. The slide deck must be &quot;professional&quot; and &quot;visually pleasing.&quot;</p>
    <h3>Planning</h3>
    <p>Before you create your slides, plan how you will organize the information. What is the best sequence to present your information? What type of visuals will best explain the concepts? How much will (or how little) information be needed?</p>
    <h3>Create the Slides</h3>
    <p>Once the information for the presentation is organized, begin assembling the slides. Since there is one slide deck to be created for the team, you should consult with your teammates on how this is to be done.<br>
      Each slide in the deck should appear to be part of the same presentation. This means there should be a uniform graphic style employed throughout. Slide decks with a random or disjoint appearance are usually assembled from different sources that have been inadequately coordinated. Since &quot;professionalism&quot; is one of the grading criteria, care should be taken in how the information in the slides is presented.<br>
      The following are types of information that may be required for your presentation:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Describe the technique.</li>
      <li>What are the advantages and      disadvantages of using this technique?</li>
      <li>What does a test look like      for this technique?</li>
      <li>Which Lifecycle Phases      (Module 1) does this technique used?</li>
      <li>What roles and      responsibilities are needed?</li>
      <li>What are the previous and      post-testing techniques? In other words, which testing technique needs to      come before and after this testing technique?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Add Cross References to your Citations</h3>
    <p>Every piece of information on the slide deck must be cited. The most common way to do this is to add citations at the bottom of each slide that uses a given piece of information. For example, if one slide utilizes information from three sources, there should be three citations on the bottom of that slide.</p>
    <h3>Plan the Presentation</h3>
    <p>The final step in the slide deck creation process is to determine how information is presented. Who is going to present a given slide? How much time are you going to spend? What stories, analogies, or examples will you use to supplement the material on the slide? All these things should be worked out before the slides are presented.</p>
    <h2>Presentation</h2>
    <p>You will be given four to five minutes to present your information for campus students. If less than four minutes are used, your grade will be impacted. If you are still talking at the five-minute mark, your presentation will be cut short. To hit the four to five-minute constraint, you and your partner(s) will need to practice.<br>
      You will need to record your presentation and upload it to a streaming service such as YouTube for online students. Your presentation must be between four and five minutes. Make sure the quality of the recording is high, with &quot;good quality&quot; audio. You are unlikely to hit the &quot;four to five-minute&quot; constraint on your first recording attempt. It might take a couple of tries to get it right.</p>
    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>You will post your presentation here. For online students, this will be a link to your video. For campus students, you will upload your slide deck here.</p>
<h2>Assessment</h2>
    <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
      <table class="rubric">
