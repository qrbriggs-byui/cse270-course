      <h1>CSE 270: W13 Draft: CMM Level 5</h1>
    </header>

    <article>
      <p>This week, we will create a plan for moving a company
        from CMM Level 1 to Level 5.
        Specifically, we are to look at all the testing activities found at each of these levels.</p>

      <h2>Scenario</h2>     
      <p>Recall our business case scenario from Week 01: 
        you just got hired as a tester for H.E.L.P, Inc. 
        This product is in its second release.
        Surprisingly, there was no test team for the first release; the development team did most of the testing.
        The resulting product had poor quality, prompting management to hire a dedicated testing team.</p>
      <p>From these humble beginnings and based on your work this semester,
        you have created a hard-working and dedicated team of testers. 
        You have even succeeded in shipping your first product.
        However, you have the feeling that success was more attributed 
        to luck and heroic efforts by a few key employees.
        You are worried that you will not be able to repeat your success next time around.</p>
      <p>To address these issues, you have become aware of the CMM levels.
        When you read about this, you were shocked to discover that your team is definitely Level 1.
        You decide to make a plan for getting to Level 5.</p>

      <h2>CMM</h2>
      <p>Our reading this week gave an overview of the CMM levels. 
        A more detailed document is available here: 
        <a href="https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=11955">Capability Maturity Model for Software, Version 1.1</a>.
        Please pay special attention to Appendix A.</p>
      <p>You and your partner(s) are to come up with plans to progress for Testing to go from Level 1 to Level 2, then Level 3, then Level 4, then Level 5.
        For each of the  headings associated with testing,("Software Quality Assurance(Level 2)" ,"Peer Reviews(Level 3)&quot;, &quot;Software Quality Management (Level 4)", and "Defect Prevention (Level 5)"),
        define the level and identify the goals. Research these goals and provide a <strong>single paragraph</strong> plan per goal as to how they can be integrated into your project.
      </p>
      <p>You will need to provide a sentence or two about the specific level associated with heading. One or more sentences about the goals of the heading. Finally how those goals are going to be achieved in the project. This is where you can used some creativity. </p>
      <p>For example, if I were to address Goal 1 of &quot;Software Project Tracking and Oversight&quot; in Level 2<br>
          for an edit team revising the documentation of tax software, my plan may be something like the following:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The team plan is to have zero typographical errors (typos) by the twelfth week.<br>
          </li>
        <li>This will be achieved by having no more than 50 new typos introduced the first week,<br>
          25 the second, 12 the third, 6 the forth, 3 the fifth, and no more than one typo introduced per week after that.<br>
          </li>
        <li>The editors and content producers will be separate teams, the former motivated to find defects<br>
          and the later to avoid introducing them.<br>
          </li>
        <li>Each typo will be reported on a status board, including the date the typo is found and the date the typo was introduced.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will need to have 4 different paragraphs, one for each heading/level. </p>
      <p>Finally, provide a <strong>one-paragraph</strong> summary of how these different levels built upon each other.
        In other words, how does Level 2 help you with Level 3 and so on?</p>


      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>Your team will submit a single document for your plan.
         The document needs to be in the PDF format.</p>

      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
      <table class="rubric">
