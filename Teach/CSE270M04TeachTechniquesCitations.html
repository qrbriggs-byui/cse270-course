  <h1>What citations did you use for your presentation on Testing Techniques?</h1>
  <h2>    Overview</h2>
  <p>    As part of the presentation on Testing Techniques, you need to provide ten at least sources. <br>
    </p>
  <h2>Topics</h2>
  <p>    You will not find much information on your topic in the course content. Instead, you will need to conduct research. Find enough quality sources to cover your topic. Your research needs to contain the following requirements:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>Quality      sources</strong>: A quality source is a source      in a peer-reviewed journal or written from a reputable source. Just about      any source found through the BYU-Idaho library will qualify here. If you      are unsure of the source's quality, look at the article's author and      verify that it has sufficient credentials. Any source with an unknown      author (such as Wikipedia) is not a quality source.</li>
    <li><strong>Cover      the topic</strong>: Support every fact you      present in your research.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The best way to conduct this research is as follows:</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>Start      at a primary and untrustworthy source like Wikipedia. A primary source      will give you an overview of the topic and not contain many factual      errors.</li>
    <li>Look at      the References and External Links section of the primary source. These      will often refer to a more trustworthy source you can cite.</li>
    <li>Find      keywords and phrases in the primary source. Search in the Library or <a href="http://scholar.google.com/schhp?hl=en">Google      Scholar</a> for quality sources using these keywords and phrases.</li>
    <li>Continue      this process until you have found quality sources on all aspects of the      topic. You can expect to read a dozen or so articles until you settle on      the half dozen or so you will need.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Post your research for your team's assigned testing techniques, find different resources, and at least one primary and 3 secondary sources. [ <a href="https://libguides.byui.edu/cs/sources">Please read BYU-I Library's Guide to sources, see Find Sources</a>]<br>
The other sources can come from each of the following categories. (Make sure that you indicate which resource type in your citation.)</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Institute,      Organization, Community&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Research      Papers </li>
    <li>Companies </li>
    <li>Books      &amp; Journals </li>
    <li>Use      Cases, Case Studies, Published data </li>
    <li>Websites </li>
    <li>Video</li>
  </ul>
