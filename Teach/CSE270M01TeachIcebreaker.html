      <p>This semester, we will be spending a great deal of time working with classmates towards shared goals.
        In order to accomplish this, we will need to form teams.
        The most successful teams have shared goals, the ability to easily meet, and have a diverse set of skills.
        To form effective teams, we need to first share a few things about ourselves.</p>

      <h2>Assignment</h2>
      <p>Please create a post to introduce yourself to your classmates. 
       This initial post must consist of the following:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Name</strong>: Your preferred name.</li>
         <li><strong>Picture</strong>: A photo of yourself.
            It could be a formal portrait, or a picture of you doing a favorite activity, or a picture of you with your family.</li>
         <li><strong>Work Schedule</strong>: What time of day and what days of the week do you work?
            This is really important for forming teams. 
            We would like to connect you with others that have a similar work schedule.</li>
         <li><strong>Career Aspiration</strong>:
            What kind of job are you looking for?
            What role would you like to do in this job?
            Is there a company that you admire and would love to work for?
            Do you have any special skills that you would like to use on the job?
            This is really important for helping teams have a diverse set of skills.
            AS it turns out, diverse teams outperform homogeneous ones.</li>  
      </ul>
      <p>After you have made your initial post,
        please respond to the post belonging to two of your classmates.
        Try to find people you would like to work with. 
        If you would like to work with someone, please indicate that in your post
        and the instructor will do his/her best to connect you.
        Your response post must consist of the following:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Name</strong>: Introduce yourself and address the other person by name.</li>
         <li><strong>Connection</strong>: Find something you two have in common.
            It may be your home town, it may be your hobby, or it may be your career aspiration.
            For example, you both may like software development, or Lego, or live in Washington.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is no length requirement for this response.</p>

      <h2>Assessment</h2>
