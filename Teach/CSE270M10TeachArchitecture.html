    <article>
      <p>Our lab this week will be to create a usability plan 
        (sometimes called a usability test plan or even a usability study plan).</p>

      <h2>Usability Plan</h2>
      <p>Using the mobile application you and your partner(s) previously selected,
        create a usability plan. 
        This will be accomplished by selecting a feature which you would like to study,
        list a set of instructions you would like the user to follow,
        and testing the plan with a friend to make sure it works as you expect.</p>

      <h3>Select a Feature</h3>
      <p>With your partner(s), select a task, feature, activity, or process which has a moderate degree of complexity.
        You are looking for an action that has about a dozen steps and more than one screen.
        For example, consider Instagram.
        An appropriate feature will be the enrollment process.
        This will consist of a new user adding a username and password to the system
        so the user can have access to Instagram's content.</p>

      <h3>Identify the Instructions</h3>
      <p>Once a feature has been selected, 
        determine the set of instructions that the user will need to in order to accomplish the task.
        If the instructions are too vague, then it is unlikely that any two users will perform the same actions.
        If the instructions are too specific, then you will learn nothing about how a real user will interact with the system.
        The challenge is to give enough guidance that the user will accomplish the task,
        but not to over-specify.</p>
      <p>The goal of this usability plan is to find defects in the feature of choice.
        In other words, will the average user be able to accomplish the task
        that the feature was designed to facilitate?</p>
      <p>Share your instructions with the other members of your team.
        Debate which set of instructions will give you the best data on the feature which was previously selected.</p>

      <h3>Test the Plan</h3>
      <p>Using a friend, family member, or roommate, test your usability plan.
        Give your test subject the instructions as you have previously written them down.
        Observe them. 
        Are they able to accomplish the task?
        Is there something you could have worded better?
        Do you need to be more or less specific?
        It may take a few rounds of testing to get the instructions right.</p>

      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>There will be one submission for the entire group.
        This submission will have a description of the feature
        and the instructions your team came up with.</p>
      <p>Note that we will collect data and report on our findings later in the week.</p>

      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
      <table class="rubric">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;</th>
            <th>Exceptional<br/>100%</th>
            <th>Good<br/>90%</th>
            <th>Acceptable<br/>70%</th>
            <th>Developing<br/>50%</th>
            <th>Missing<br/>0%</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Plan Quality<br/>50%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>The usability plan is likely to yield high quality data</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>The plan will test the feature of choice</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>The plan has one or two glaring defects</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>The usability plan is unlikely to produce meaningful data</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>Usability plan is missing</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Plan Clarity<br/>50%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>There is "no way" the user will misconstrue the instructions</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>Every item in the usability plan is clear</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>There are minor opportunities to misconstrue the instructions</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>The instructions are vague, incomplete, or confusing</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>The instructions are missing or should be completely redone</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
