      <h1>CSE 270: W04 Quiz Questions: Testing Techniques</h1>
    </header>
    <article>
      <p>The final deliverable is to come up with three quiz questions drawn from your presentation.
        With these questions, try to capture the "core lessons" to be learned from your presentation.
        In other words, don't bother to create a question that is trivial.
        Focus instead on the information worth learning.
      What are the three key takeaways from your topic?</p>
      <p>These three quiz questions will be submitted separately 
        on the next assignment in this lesson.
        <strong>Please make sure to clearly indicate the correct answer</strong>.
        Each question must be one of these types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>True/False (one correct answer or one incorrect answer)</li>
        <li>Multiple choice (one correct answer, many incorrect answers)</li>
        <li>Multiple select (n-correct answers, many incorrect answers)</li>
        <li>Matching (1-to-1 or n-to-1 or n-to-m) [auto grade] </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is easy to formulate fact-based questions.
        However, you should create comprehension or reasoning questions:</p>
      
      <h3>Fact-Based Questions</h3>
      <p>Fact-based questions are easy questions. 
        Is it equal or not equal to the definition or situation. 
        Often it is possible to correctly answer a fact-based question without understanding the material.
        The following are examples of fact-based questions:</p>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li><strong>True/False</strong>: Statement of fact. For example:<br/>
            <em>The * symbol is used for multiplication.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Multiple Choice</strong>: Selection of the correct answer. For example:<br/>
            <em>Which of the following symbols corresponds to multiplication?<br/>
              A. -<br/>
              B. +<br/>
              C. *<br/>
              D. /</em>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Matching</strong>: Match a name with a description,
            much like several multiple choice questions combined in one. For example:<br/>
            <em>Match the name with the definition:<br/>
            <table style="width: 100%">
              <colgroup>
                 <col span="1" style="width: 50%;">
                 <col span="1" style="width: 50%;">
              </colgroup>             
              <tbody>
                 <tr>
                   <td> 
                      A. -<br/>
                      B. +<br/>
                      C. *<br/>
                      D. /</td>
                   <td >
                      1. Division<br/>
                      2. Addition<br/>
                      3. Subtraction<br/>
                      4. Multiplication</td>
                 </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            </em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Comprehension questions require the subject to understand the problem fully. They cannot be answered by searching for facts. The facts must be understood first. The following are examples of comprehension-based questions:</p>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li><strong>True/False</strong>:      Using comparison or understanding of facts. For example:<br>
          <em>Multiplication is like performing several additions.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Multiple Choice</strong>:      Selection of the correct answer. For example:<br>
          <em>Which of the following symbols would be useful in find the number of      apples in a bag?</em><em><br>
            <em>A. -</em><br>
            <em>B. +</em><br>
            <em>C. *</em><br>
            <em>D. /</em></em></li>
        <li><strong>Matching</strong>:      Once again, like several multiple choices combined. For example:<br>
          <em>Match the scenario with the mathematical operator:</em>
          <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">
            <colgroup>
              <col span="1">
              <col span="1">
            </colgroup>
            <tr>
              <td><p>A. -<br>
                B. +<br>
                C. *<br>
                D. /</p></td>
              <td><p>1. Subdivide into groups<br>
                2. Find the number of apples in a bag<br>
                3. Determine how many are left after some are removed<br>
                4. Tabulate by groups</p></td>
            </tr>
          </table>
	  </ul>
          <h3>Reasoning Questions</h3>
          <p>Reasoning questions require the subject to understand rules and then apply them in a novel situation. they involve not only understanding facts, but knowing how to use them. The following are examples of comprehension-based questions:</p>
          <ul type="circle">
            <li><strong>True/False</strong>:      Using comparison or understanding of facts. For example:<br>
              <em>Forty two times three is one hundred twenty six.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Multiple Choice</strong>:      Selection of the correct answer. For example:<br>
              <em>What is forty two times three?</em><em><br>
                <em>A. 39</em><br>
                <em>B. 45</em><br>
                <em>C. 126</em><br>
                <em>D. 14</em></em></li>
            <li><strong>Matching</strong>:      Once again, like several multiple choices combined. For example:<br>
              <em>Match the equation with the answer:</em><em>          </em>
              <ul type="circle">
                <li>
                  <table style="width: 100%">
                    <colgroup>
                      <col span="1" style="width: 50%;">
                      <col span="1" style="width: 50%;">
                    </colgroup>
                    <tbody>
                      <tr>
                        <td><em> A. 42 - 3<br/>
                          B. 42 + 3<br/>
                          C. 42 * 3<br/>
                        D. 42 / 3</em></td>
                        <td ><em> 1. 39<br/>
                          2. 45<br/>
                          3. 126<br/>
                        4. 14</em></td>
                      </tr>
                    </tbody>
                  </table>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>The key difference between reasoning and other types of questions is 
                that you cannot memorize your way through a reasoning test.
                To answer these questions, you need to be able to perform multiplication,
                not just know what it means.</p>
		</ul>
              <h2>Submission</h2>
              <p>You should have 3-4 questions. The instructor will use your questions to form the end-of-the-week quiz. You need to provide the answers to your questions.</p>
              
              
              <h2>Assessment</h2>
              <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
              <table class="rubric">
