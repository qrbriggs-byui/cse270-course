    <article>
      <p>A good way to understand a career path in a given area is to look at the various types of job that are available.
        To help us understand testing career paths, we will start by researching testing jobs.</p>
      <p>Note that this is an individual assignment.
        Post your findings on a discussion board for the entire class to see.
      </p>

      <h2>Three Jobs</h2>
      <p>Find three job openings for testers on the internet.
        You can look at specific companies (such as Google or Apple)
        or you can look at job placement services (like Monster).
        <strong>Make sure that the jobs openings you found were not previously found by your classmates</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Summarize Each</h2>
      <p>Once you found three jobs, then summarize what they entail.
        These summaries should include the following, but you may wish to add additional information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Job title</li>
        <li>Salary</li>        
        <li>Required education</li>
        <li>Required certifications</li>
        <li>Required technology skills</li>
        <li>Duties and responsibilities</li>
        <li>Link to the job opening</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Report</h2>
      <p>Report on your findings in this discussion board.
        Create a unique thread for each job opening you found.
        Make sure that the job opening was not previously reported by your classmates!</p>


      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
      <table class="rubric">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;</th>
