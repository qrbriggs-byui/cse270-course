      <p>Our lab this week will be creating a bug report templates.
        In order to do this, we first must research some bug templates. Then create your own template. Then select five bugs to make bug reports to test your template. </p>
      <h2>Research Bug Reports</h2>
      <p>in your group discuss what fields make a good bug report. Find 4-5 sites that talk or demostrate different bug reports. Discuss each field and the importance and use of that field in helping to solve the bug. </p>
      <h2>Create a Bug Report Template</h2>
      <p>In order to actually create a bug report, you need a template that a user can quickly fill out that contains enough information on what the user did to get to the error. Create a template bug report. </p>

      <h2>Select Defects</h2>
      <p>With your partner(s), open the <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse270-course/Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a> application.
        This application has several defects.
        Some of the defects are the following:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Login: The user was unable to enter a password</li>
        <li>Login: Username and password was not validated</li>
        <li>Login: Username and password was not verified</li>
        <li>Setting: Software is unable to detect Battery values from BatterySensor</li>
        <li>Setting: Software is unable to see Solar deals from SolarSensor</li>
        <li>Setting: Sound Sensors are not working</li>
        <li>Setting: Vibration Sensors are not working</li>
        <li>Setting: User information is not displayed</li>
        <li>Setting: Communication features are not installed</li>
        <li>PatientMenu's AddPatient does not allow the user to input the Last Name</li>
        <li>PatientMenu's AddPatient Add button does not clear previous NewID </li>
        <li>PatientMenu's Diagnosis: Enter Temperature does not validate input</li>
        <li>PatientMenu's Diagnosis: Enter Heartbeat does not validate input</li>
        <li>PatientMenu's Diagnosis: Enter O2 Level does not validate input</li>
        <li>PatientMenu's Diagnosis Enter Blood Pressure inputs both values but should be two fields</li>
        <li>PatientMenu's Monitor does not display O2 Level</li>
        <li>PatientMenu's AddPatient Cancel button clears/deletes Patients information if Enter New Id contains the Patient ID</li>
        <li>PatientMenu's Diagnosis Bandages feature does not update Communicate Order Supplies when usage exceeds threshold settings</li>
        <li>PatientMenu's Diagnosis Cleanser feature does not update Communicate Order Supplies when usage exceeds threshold settings</li>
        <li>PatientMenu's Diagnosis Tissue feature does not update Communicate Order Supplies when usage exceeds the threshold in settings</li>
        <li>PickupTransport: The request Supply Drop feature is not implemented</li>
        <li>PickupTransport: Request Pickup of Patient feature is not implemented</li>
        <li>PickupTransport: Request Transport Home feature is not implemented</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With your partner(s), investigate these defects and choose five you will use to test  your bug reports template due on Saturday.</p>

      <h2>Bug Report Format</h2>
      <p>Investigate different bug report formats presented in the reading and from the internet.
        Based on these findings, present them to your partner(s).
        When you have agreed on a format, present a sample bug report here.</p>

      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>There will be one submission for the entire group.
        This submission will include a list of the defects you will report on,
        and the  bug report tempate which will serve as your template.</p>

      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
      <table class="rubric">
        <tbody>
