    <article>
      <p>Our lab this week will be to create a risk management plan 
        for the H.E.L.P. Inc. mobile application previously used this semester.</p>

      <h2>Scenario</h2>
      <p>The H.E.L.P. Inc. mobile application is a tool to facilitate medical workers
        record and share patient health care data.
        After much work, the development team believes they have sorted out all the technical issues.
        It is your team's job to identify the non-technical risks to the project.</p>

      <h2>Risk Identification</h2>
      <p>Risks to a project can come from a variety of sources:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Medical: Insurance, services, and payments of a health care giver</li>
        <li>Governmental: Local, city, state, and federal government policies and laws</li>
        <li>Political: Interpersonal issues, pride, dealing with hierarchy and authority of power</li>
        <li>Academic: Schools, education and learning, and standard of living</li>
        <li>Corporate: Trade secrets, rivalries, etc.</li>
        <li>Military: Protection of civilians, advancing national interests, military secrets</li>
        <li>Religious: Matters of faith and morality</li>
        <li>Others: Is there another source not listed here?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These risks can manifest themselves in a variety of ways or types:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Security: Providing confidentiality, integrity, and availability assurances.</li>
        <li>Ethical: Aligned with moral standards.</li>
        <li>Financial: Could the project fail in the marketplace?</li>
        <li>Legal: Could a law be broken or could the authors be sued?</li>
        <li>Other: What other types of risk are there?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Risk Report</h2>
      <p>With your partner(s), come up with a complete and comprehensible list of risks 
        to our H.E.L.P. Inc. mobile application.
        Each risk should contain the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Name</strong>: 
          Give each risk a name.</li>
        <li><strong>Source</strong>: 
          Medical, governmental, political, academic, corporate, military, or religious.</li>
        <li><strong>Type</strong>: 
          Security, ethical, financial, or legal.</li>
        <li><strong>Severity</strong>:
          Give a two or three sentence description of how severe the risk is.</li>
        <li><strong>Description</strong>:
          Give a two or three sentence description of the risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Citation</strong>:
          Any source that informed you of this risk.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When making severity determinations, it is helpful to think of frequency and impact.
        If it occurs often and is severe, it is considered high risk.
        If it does occur often or is not highly severe, then it is medium risk.
        If it doesn't occur often and is not severe, then it is low risk.</p>

      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>Your team will submit a single document for your risks.
         The document needs to be in the PDF format.
         The number of risks will vary by team.
         For example, one team may have one broadly-defined risk
         whereas another may have six risks that describe the same issue.
         Nevertheless, a good rule-of-thumb is to have a few dozen risks.</p>

      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
      <table class="rubric">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;</th>
            <th>Exceptional<br/>100%</th>

            <th>Acceptable<br/>70%</th>
            <th>Developing<br/>50%</th>
            <th>Missing<br/>0%</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Risk List<br/>30%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>The list of risks is comprehensive</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>The list of risks contains a wide variety of types from a wide variety of sources</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>Some obvious risks are missing</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>The risk plan consists of "several" risks</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>The risk plan consists of less than two risks</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Risk Quality<br/>40%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>Every risk is completely described</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>Each risk contains no obvious omissions</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>There exists several fully-formed risks</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>Elements of the solution exist</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>No single risk is well-formed</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Professionalism<br/>20%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>The report is professional, easy to read, and all the ideas are clearly communicated</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>The writing style is "professional:" there are no grammar, spelling, or formatting errors</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>There exists an instance of a spelling error, grammar error, overly verbose wording, poor formatting, or poor writing</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>Multiple spelling, grammatical, formatting, or writing errors</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>Gross spelling/grammar errors or other aspects of the writing 
              that make the report difficult to read</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Citations<br/>10%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>Everything is fully cited and all the citations are from high-quality sources</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>Everything is fully cited</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>There exists a few missing citations or some citations are of insufficient quality</td>

<!-- 0   --><td>No citations</td>
          </tr>
