      <p>Gathering information about the system under test (the thing we are testing) is critical in the testing process. Without understanding how the system is supposed to work, how can we know if we found a defect? This learning activity aims to report on what we have seen in our research and to read about what other people have found. This will be done in a three-step process. First, carefully read the three sources you have previously found. Second, write about what you have learned in a discussion board thread. Finally, read what other people have found about the same camera.</p>
      <h2>Understand Your Sources</h2>
      <p>If we did our job correctly, the three sources we found about how our camera's auto-focus feature works (in the &quot;Reading&quot; part of this week's assignment) will tell us everything we need to know. Take a few minutes and re-read these sources. As you do so, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Do I      understand the auto-focus system enough to explain it to someone else? Can      I answer questions if someone were to ask?</li>
        <li>Do all      three sources agree? If not, on what points do they disagree?</li>
        <li>Is      there anything about the auto-focus algorithm that is not adequately      covered? Will I need to find a fourth (or even fifth) source?</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Report on Your Finding</h2>
      <p>Once we understand how the auto-focus system works, the next step is to share our understanding with the rest of the class. This, too, is done in a multi-step process.</p>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li><strong>Search      for a previous thread.</strong> Ideally, we will have all the      information for a given camera located in a single thread. If your camera      already has a thread on this week's discussion board, then reply to that      thread. If not, create a thread clearly indicating which camera you are      describing. Note that two cameras using a similar auto-focus strategy will      have different technical specifications. Therefore, a distinct thread will      be needed for every camera. </li>
        <li><strong>Report      on everything you have learned.</strong> This will probably take      several paragraphs, depending on the complexity of the auto-focus system.      Make sure to include as many technical details as you can.</li>
        <li><strong>Cite      your sources.</strong> If a fact is mentioned      explicitly in your report, make sure that point is cited so others can go      directly to the source and verify your findings. A simple hyperlink is      sufficient.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Read other Reports</h2>
      <p>Ideally, several people will be using the same camera. If that is the case, you can benefit from their research and your own. Unfortunately, everyone will not be reporting on their research simultaneously. This means that we will have to go back to the discussion board after the due date to complete the next task for the week. </p>
      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>Submit a post to the discussion board containing the following information: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Report on your finding of a camera&rsquo;s auto-focus capabilities. You should include different types of focus algorithms, uses, conditions, etc. </li>
        <li>Citations: You must have at least different sources (two sources about auto-focus algorithms, and one additional source about camera focusing.) </li>
      </ul>
<h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
      <table class="rubric">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;</th>

            <th>Developing<br/>50%</th>
            <th>Missing<br/>0%</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Report Content<br/>50%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>It is clear the author completely understands the auto-focus mechanism</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>The report is complete</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>One or two key details are missing</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>Insufficient detail</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>Post is missing</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Professionalism<br/>30%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>The report is professional, easy to read, and all the ideas are clearly communicated</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>The writing style is "professional:" there are no grammar, spelling, or formatting errors</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>There exists an instance of a spelling error, grammar error, overly verbose wording, poor formatting, or poor writing</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>Multiple spelling, grammatical, formatting, or writing errors</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>Gross spelling/grammar errors or other aspects of the writing 
              that make the report difficult to read</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Citations<br/>20%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>Everything is fully cited and all the citations are from high-quality sources</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>Everything is fully cited</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>There exists a few missing citations or some citations are of insufficient quality</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>There are a few citations </td>
<!-- 0   --><td>No citations</td>
