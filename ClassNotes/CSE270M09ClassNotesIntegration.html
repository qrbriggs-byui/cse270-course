  <h1>Notes for Classroom</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>As software is being developed, many times it is divided into different pieces, top-down design, and worked independently. As some point the piece need to come back together. When all the pieces come together, the problems really begin to pile up. Much like making bread, you can&rsquo;t put all the ingredients in the mixer at the same time and expect perfect bread. Assembly of software is a key component to delivering on time. Understanding how to describe the inputs getting processed to output throughout the entire workflow is a vital skill in delivery the desired product. In addition to making sure that product is comes together, there is also making sure it works with other 3rd party components, interfaces, and standards.</p>

  <h2>Announcement</h2>
  <p><strong>Welcome to Week 09: Integration  Testing</strong> <br>
This week you will be learning about  Integration Tests.<br>
There are essentially four different  types of tests.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Unit Tests check the implementation for errors at each       unit of work. As each unit is finished it is added to the whole.</li>
    <li>Integration Tests grow as the units are finished. If       not organized correctly, this can be a nightmare quickly. Usually, a plan       is needed to keep them straight.</li>
    <li>System Tests are end-to-end tests and verify that the       entire system has been fully integrated. In larger projects, an extension       of system tests is Acceptance Tests are tests. Acceptance tests show to       the customer that the system validates their needs.</li>
    <li>Regression Test is a series of happy path tests. Each       time Units are added or changed the system needs to be tested to verify       most of the system still works, and the change or new capability has not       introduced new bugs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Image, for a moment you own a car if  you do not already have one. The Unit Tests are the individual parts of the car.  For example, tires go through a thorough examination before they are installed.  An Integration Test is the test drive and performance tests on the track after  the car is assembled. The System or Acceptance test the customer test driving  the car at the car dealer. The Regression test is the 14-to-30-point inspection  that the car mechanic does when you bring it in for service.<br>
    This week you will be developing an  Integration Plan.&nbsp; This is like a report and not a set of tests. Since we  are working with a small application, the plan is essentially an outline to  keep track of the progress of integrating the units and testing them.<br>
    Please follow the updated outline  for the plan. You will be using parts from the previous assignment to assemble  the plan. So, this is equivalent to a midterm.</p>
<h2>During the Week (Teach)</h2>
  <p>Classroom Day 1:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Discuss which Testing Techniques are used at the Different levels (Week 4)</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Discuss on Full-Stack and End-to-End processing</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Multi-language (Functional, OO, Procedural), (Compile, Scripting, blend)</li>
      <li>Throwing  everything together at the end is a huge risk, and integration testing is the  mitigation</li>
