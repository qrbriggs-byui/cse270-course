  <h1>Notes for Classroom</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Looking at the broader view of the software, does it address  security,   liability, legal regulation and ethical issues? How do you test for    that?</p>
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p>By the end of the week, each student will be able to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Break down Security/Risk/Legal aspects of  testing</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Before the Week Begins (Prepare)</h2>

  <h2>Announcement</h2>
  <p>Welcome to Week 12: Testing Issues.<br>
This week, we will discuss testing issues about security,  liability, legal regulations, and ethical issues. <br>
Testing is one of the last defenses before the product is  delivered to the customer to find quality issues. Testing may be worked  throughout the development lifecycle, but it still is the final gate to verify  and validate the customer's needs have been fulfilled. <br>
As it always has been, security is a significant quality of  software that has often been ignored. It reflects on the liability that  software has in our world, from medical, government, politics, academia,  corporations, military, and religions. Every field depends on software. Every area  uses software to solve the problems of that domain. If there is a problem with  the solution, the software will get be blamed first. When the software receives  accused, the first question that everyone asks is, &quot;Why didn't that get  tested before it was delivered?&quot; <br>
This week you will be looking at the different issues found  with Dr. Mobile and with Testing in general. You are going to find the issues  and associated risks, then create a mitigation plan for each issue. <br>
Risk is a major difficulty of developing any product. Risk  is a part of life. For the most part, humans are averse to risk, and we don't  like it. One of the major attributes of a mature project is to manage risk. Personally,  we do this all the time. We manage risk by getting a good night's sleep,  exercising, and eating healthy; having a life, home, and car insurance; investing  in our retirement, home, marriage, and family. One way risk is measure by how  often it occurs and what the severity is. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If it occurs often and is severe, it is considered  high risk. </li>
    <li>If it does occur often or is not highly severe,  then it is medium risk, and </li>
    <li>If it doesn't occur often and is not severe,  then it is a low risk. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This example's scale is binary but works on different scales  from 1 to 3 to 1 to 10 depending on you the detail of the problem. Not all risk  uses these two variables.  <br>
    Risk severity assists in determining the budget when it  occurs. The high risk will cost a lot, so mitigation plans need to be put in  place to reduce the risk. <br>
    There are four types of mitigation techniques that allow the  use manage Risk: Prevention, Transference, Acceptance, Avoidance. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prevention mitigation is the process of putting up  a defense to prevent it from happening. This is usually in the form of a  mitigation plan. For example, to mitigate the risk of your car being stolen,  you look at the doors, have a really loud security alarm, and it is stored in  the locked garage. </li>
    <li>Transference typically has an insurance policy  that will cover the costs that might happen from the fall out of the risk. For  example, to prevent paying for replacing your car and having to pay others and  your medical bill, you have car insurance that lowers that payment to a  manageable deductible.  </li>
    <li>Acceptance is holding a reserve to handle the risk,  and you know it is going to happen, and it is just part of the business. For  example, you accept that driving on the highway may cause death or injury or  getting a tune-up on the car as parts wear out. </li>
    <li>Avoidance is changing the activity, process or  having a policy that will not all the risk to happen.  For example, you avoid driving at night if you  have night vision problems, or you avoid driving during bad weather if your  tires are not new. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can reduce the risk by applying one or many mitigation  techniques. <br>
    Measuring mitigation techniques uses the same techniques as  measuring risk. Did it lower it from high or medium to a lower state, or did it  reduce the cost (severity) or reduce the occurrence. <br>
    This week assignment:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In the Lab, you will practice writing ten issues  associated with Dr. Mobile and do a risk analysis on those issues. You will  then decide on risk mitigation techniques and how you would measure them. </li>
    <li>For the Prove, you will expand this to the  entire field of Testing. Use an article you got from week one or use a  different testing issue. </li>
  </ul>
