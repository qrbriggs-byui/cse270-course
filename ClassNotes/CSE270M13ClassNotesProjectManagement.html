  <h1>Notes for Classroom</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In order to maintain consistency between projects, companies  need to   establish policies, plans, and procedures that are applied to all    projects. Having the ability to understand the differences, read them,   and  produce these will be invaluable and increase ROI to the company.   Understanding  the different roles of CM, DM and Software Management in   the role of Testing  helps with the production and delivery of software.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Other Roles
      <ul>
        <li>Configuration Managements consists of legal  accounting   of 3rd party software (COTS, FOSS), project development software,    integrated software as part of the delivery, and delivery constraints   and  scenarios.</li>
        <li>Data Managements consists of document control  and   versioning, software development folders, tests &amp; test data, and    licensing issues.</li>
        <li>Software Management consists of code  repositories, versioning and patching software, delivery scheduling and peer  reviews.</li>
        <li>Change Management consists of how and when code,  libraries and data change, and the effects of downstream changes</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Students will distinguish between standards,  regulations, policies, plans, procedures, and instructions</li>
    <li>Students will explore different testing and  supporting roles associated with testing</li>
    <li>Students will be able to produce project  products to support the health of a project.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p>By the end of the week, each student will be able to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Arrange policies, plans, and procedures </li>
    <li>Utilize CMM Level to distinguish roles,  reconsolidates, and deliverables.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Before the Week Begins (Prepare)</h2>
  <p>Instructor Resources</p>
  <p>Preparation: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reading</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Partnership/Group work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Partners are going to work on the Lab and Ponder assignments to create two plans, one dealing with delivery and the other with project management.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Announcement</h2>
  <h3>Welcome to Week 13. </h3>
  <p><br>
    As with any team, if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. A  team plan helps with the organization, sets the scope and purpose of the group.  This is also a fantastic week to help you understand the summary of the class. <br>
    As part of any software test team, there are two things that  you must consider. The product is one side of the coin, an outline in the  Integration test plan in week 09. The other part of the coin is the process of  making the product. The process is outline in the Project Test Plan. <br>
    The project test plan outlines when and how events and  resources are used together to create the product. <br>
  Consider this the final report for this semester. Next week  we will be discussing career opportunities and paths associated with testing.</p>
