  <h1>Notes for Classroom</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>One of the biggest arguments that both management  and software   practitioners use is &ldquo;there is not enough time to do testing&rdquo;. Or it is   the last thing on the schedule and gets time  constrained.</p>
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p>By the end of the week, each student will be able to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Evaluate Testing Business Issues</li>
    <li>Propose Business Case for Testing Overview</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Before the Week Begins (Prepare)</h2>
  <p>Instructor Resources</p>
  <p>Preparation: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Download the "<strong>IEEE Software Engineering Book  of Knowledge</strong>". Read Chapter 4 on "Software Testing".
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.computer.org/education/bodies-of-knowledge/software-engineering">https://www.computer.org/education/bodies-of-knowledge/software-engineering</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Find two or three articles about software testing to share with the class. </li>
    
  </ul>
  <p>Partnership/Group work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Partner Assignments: You will need to identify  location of students,   either by time zone or location to help with creating  partnerships for   the rest of the course.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Class Announcements</h2>
  <p>This week we will be covering the Fundamentals and Issues of  software testing. <br>
    Many immature projects don&rsquo;t have an adequate testing policy  or plan. Many times development is just trying to get the product coded. A lack  of testing or the schedule squeeze is one of the contributing factors of the  1970&rsquo;s Software Crisis and why the majority of today&rsquo;s projects. Many  programmers and managers feel testing is time-consuming and don&rsquo;t plan  according. By the end of the week, you should feel confident that you can  justify a Business Case for Software Testing. <br>
    The fundamentals of testing, presented in Software  Engineering Book of Knowledge, published by IEEE, consist of Testing Levels,  Techniques, Measurements, Process, and Tools. <br>
    During this course, we will be covering each of these in a  broad and some area in-depth. <br>
    As part of your preparation, you need to read Chapter 4 of  the SEBoK. You will use this knowledge to explore questions about testing  fundamentals.<br>
    You also need to find two articles that you can write a  summary on about software testing. You can use any resource, but make sure you  cite the resource. You might have to read several articles, or you might know  some that you have already read. I have found software testing issues in the  news from several different sources, including LinkedIn, Newspapers, Facebook,  and Slashdot. Â I am excited to see what  source you find and the articles that you find. <br>
    The prove assignment is for you to write a business case for  testing. The assignment provides a backstory and a brief overview of the  assignment. The case should be 1-3 pages. I would suggest examples of solutions  from your articles or your classmates as part of the risks. <br>
    The assignment&rsquo;s requirements are set at 89%. To get 100%,  you need to Make It Your Own. I provided some suggestions, but you can add as  you see fit. You must identify what you did to Make It Your Own in the assignment  comments; otherwise, I will default it at 89%. <br>
  Please make sure you have complete the assignment surveys  and Ponder quizzes. The surveys will help us improve the course. </p>

          How would you convince your boss, manager, lead to pay more attention to testing?<br>
