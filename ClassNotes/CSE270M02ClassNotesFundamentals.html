  <h2>Class Announcement</h2>
  <p><strong>Welcome  to Week 02: Testing Fundamentals</strong><br>
One of the attributes of a  professional is working with other people, organizations, and resources. This  week you are going to find one of these resources and report back on it.<br>
In continuing with last week's H.E.L.P.  Inc Testing Team, this week you will be working on a team mission statement. As  a four-part discussion thread.<br>
For the lab you are going to figure  out how to test the autofocus of a camera, posting your technique or test. Then  run through a couple of your classmates to see if you can improve yours.<br>
Lastly, you are going to use your  mission statement as part of the training flyer for H.E.L.P. Inc. The intention  is for you to post this on a Professional Network, but not required, I would  recommend your Portfolio at the minimum/required.<br>
