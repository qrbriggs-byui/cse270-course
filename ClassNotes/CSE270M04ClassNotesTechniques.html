  <h1>Notes for Classroom</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>There are several types of testing techniques, including    exploratory, domain, flow, and box testing. There are techniques that run   the  throughout the lifecycle (later week), provide different approaches,   and coverage,  based on the need and purpose of the software. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>This week students will explore and present on  different techniques and the pros and cons of each.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p>By the end of the week, each student will be able to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Summarize Testing Techniques (Exploratory,  Domain, Flow, Box, etc.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Announcements</h2>
  <p><strong>Welcome  to Week 04 Testing Techniques.</strong><br>
This week you will be working with  your group again.<br>
Your group has been assigned a  specific Testing Technique. You will research it, present a video recording of  it and 3-4 questions about it.<br>
You, individually, will review other  videos in helping you take a test on it.<br>
<a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse270-course/Teach/CSE270M04TeachTechniquesPresentations.html" target="_blank"><strong>Testing Technique  Presentations&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</strong></a><strong> </strong><br>
Please read all the instructions  before you begin, so you know the scope of the assignment. There are four parts  to this week's assignment (Research, Presentation, Questions, and Quiz).<br>
<strong>Researching your testing technique:  (60 pts) </strong> <br>
Below you will find your group  assigned, you need to research the topic. Feel free to use any of the readings  as one type of resource. You will need to provide 4 primary sources, and  secondary sources need to come from each of the following categories. [ <a href="https://libguides.byui.edu/cs/sources" target="_blank">Please read BYU-I Library's Guide to sources, see  Find Sources&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</a>]</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Institute, Organization, Community</li>
    <li>Research Papers</li>
    <li>Companies</li>
    <li>Books &amp; Journals</li>
    <li>Use Cases, Case Studies, Published data</li>
    <li>Websites</li>
    <li>Video</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Label your source type, to be easily  identifiable, so it is easier to grade.<br>
    <strong>Create your presentation:</strong> <br>
    After you have researched your  topic, create a presentation about your testing technique. You then need to  record the presentation. &nbsp;Post your presentation and recording in the  Presentation discussion board.<br>
    I will be looking for  professional-looking slides, everyone presenting, questions were answered in  the presentation, and how the topics relate to other techniques (suggested pre  &amp; post testing techniques) and topics we have covered in the class.<br>
  <strong>Creating questions about your  presentation.</strong> <br>
    Your group needs to come up with 3-4  questions about your presentation. See assignment details. These need to be  turned in by Thursday evening. I will then take those questions and put them in  the Ponder Quiz for the week. You need to come up with 40 pts worth of  questions to get full credit. Remember you need to label the question type by  Complexity and Difficulty. &nbsp;i.e.: Comprehension/Multiple Select.<br>
    You will have until next Tuesday to  view your classmates&rsquo; videos and presentations and take the quiz.<br>
    Upload your questions as a text  file, formatting with Word or other files interferes with the transfer.</p>
  <p><strong>Ponder Quiz</strong> <br>
    Once I have all the questions by Thursday  Night, Friday morning, I will then take those questions and put them in the  Ponder Quiz for the week. You need to come up with 40 pts worth of questions to  get full credit. Remember you need to label the question type by Complexity and  Difficulty. &nbsp;i.e.: Comprehension/Multiple Select.<br>
    You will have until next Tuesday to  view your classmates&rsquo; videos and presentations and take the quiz. You can take  the quiz as many times as you need. My suggestion would be to take the quiz  once to get the questions, then watch the videos. Then take the quiz again  after you have gotten all the answers from the videos.</p>
