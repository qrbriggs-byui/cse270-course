  <h1>Notes for Classroom</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Testing is a critical phase just before delivering the  software out   the door (DevOps). Too many times the phase is squeezed. Finding    solutions to work faster in these times helps with the stress. Different   tools  are available to help practitioners work more efficiently and   faster in S/W  Testing. Having the right tool for the right job is a   sign of a professional.  Many times, knowing how to make tools when none   are available is a valuable  skill. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Students will get an overview of DevOps, and a  testers role in the delivery of software. </li>
    <li>Students will identify and judge testing tools,  software and workflows</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p>By the end of the week, each student will be able to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand the critical role testing has in  DevOps </li>
    <li>Evaluate Testing Tools</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Before the Week Begins (Prepare)</h2>
  <p>Instructor Resources</p>
  <p>Preparation: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Assign teams or partners a tool to do research on and create a poster presentation.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DevOps:</strong> Azure, Jenkins, or a tools from DZone  DevOps</li>
        <li><strong>Testing Platform: </strong>Protector,   Selenium*, Telerik, Mocha, Dragon,  FitNesse, CruiseControl, QuickBuild /   JBoss Developer, Quality Center,  VersionOne, Jira, Microsoft CodedUI,   QuickTest Pro </li>
        <li><strong>Testing Program: </strong>Angular, Junit</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A practitioner  always has a list of things that they know how to do and can do them well for  given situations, these are called best practices. Assign partnership to  research Tester responsibilities for  Day 3
      <ul>
        <li>Task Management (Action Item Database) </li>
        <li> Issue Management (Deficiency Database)</li>

      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Partnership/Group work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Will work on researching and creating a poster. 
      <ul>
        
        <li>Uses of tool, Situations that the tool might be used</li>
            <li>Advantages and Disadvantages over other tools in  the same category</li>
            <li>What type of benchmarks are used? </li>
            <li>What type of scripts, harnesses, framework, and  environment would the tool be used in?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Students need to research the practice.   Using the tool that you researched, identify how your tools would be   used in the practice.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Announcement</h2>
  <p><strong>Welcome to Week 06 Testing Tools.</strong><br>
    There are a ton of testing tools, from DevOps tools (Azure,  Jenkins) to Testing Platforms(Protector, Selenium, Telerik, Mocha) to Testing  Programs (Angular, Junit). Each of these tools assists tester in automating and  increasing performance. They don&rsquo;t necessarily help find the bugs. Finding bugs  is the difficult part of testing, and why we had discussed the methods of  testing first before we discussed the cool tools. <br>
    This week we are going to mention the cool tools. Your team  will be assigned a tool to research and create a post about the tool. <br>
    For the lab, you will also install Microsoft Visual Studio  and install Selenium on your computer. We will be using this for later labs. <br>
  For the Ponder, you will be comparing two different testing  tools and comparing it to Selenium. Selenium is one of the most popular tools  used in Testing, but is it? As part of this assignment, you need to determine  if Selenium is the best choice for your project. For the two products, use one  from the Teach Posters, and for the other, find one not on the Teach assignment  list.Â  </p>
