  <h1>Notes for Classroom</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>One of the first tests that all programmers implement before  or   after implementing design is a unit test. These test the scope of the    functionality of the code. Week 7 is the implementation of Week 5. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Students will demonstrate simple tests as a  programmer for a test team </li>
    <li>Students will create manual and automated tests  for code</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p>By the end of the week, each student will be able to: </p>
  <ul>
    
    <li>Implement Unit Tests </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Before the Week Begins (Prepare)</h2>

  <p>Class Room Day 1:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Discuss when	to write tests, depending on the software maturity level (Requirements,  Design, Implement, or Test), which type of tests to use (Inspection, Analysis,  Simulation, Demonstration).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Class Room Day 2:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Discuss how to write tests</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Class Room Day 3:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify a coding style. Research testing  techniques that could be   used. What are some risks and mitigations (at least  two)? </li>
    <li>Discuss Unit 4,5,6 in relation   to Test Cases</li>

  <h2>Announcement</h2>
  <p><strong>CSE 270: Welcome to Week 7: Test cases</strong><br>
This week you are going to learn how to write test cases. Writing  test cases is a simple task in some cases and a complete task in other cases. <br>
For Teach 07, we will start with simple cases. I have  provided a list of simple tasks that you need to figure out how to verify. Â You will have to define the requirement that  you are verifying, which is a bit more than just the story I provided, or you  can provide your own story. Provide the steps, and how you know you have  completed the story, what the evidence is. Yes, if you think this is like the  scientific method, you are correct. The requirement is the thesis, the test  steps are the experiment, and the verification is the conclusion. <br>
I have found that there is a simple format for writing test  steps as a programmer or tester. A tester or user does something, and then the  software reacts. So you write a &ldquo;step&rdquo; action and a &ldquo;results&rdquo; statement. Instead  of the &ldquo;results,&rdquo; you write it as a &ldquo;verification&rdquo; statement when you get to  the end. The &ldquo;step/results&rdquo; lead up or set up the system to be &ldquo;step/verified.&rdquo; <br>
For the Lab, you are working with Dr. Mobile again,  designing four tests. You will find the link to Dr. Mobile's application HTML file  in the assignment, and you will notice that the Sensors are not installed yet,  and this assignment is a follow-on to the week 05 lab assignment. Because the  project is developing the software independently of the hardware, you are writing  the tests without the hardware available. You can use simulated equipment like  your phone, computer, tablet, or any other electronic device. Make sure you use  the &ldquo;step/results|verified&rdquo; method. Make sure you reply to your classmate's  post as part of the review process. </p>
  <p>For the Ponder assignment, you will write other tests using  the &ldquo;step/results|verified&rdquo; method. You will base them on different methods of  testing: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Manual (which is what you did for the Lab), </li>
    <li>Automated (you can use selenium if you want, but  providing a paper version of a plan is find)</li>
    <li>Analysis </li>
    <li>Demo</li>
    <li>Inspection</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Feel free to use your imagination, and provide your  assumptions. </p>
<h2>Post Mortem: </h2>
  <p>After each class answer the following questions: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Key Analysis
      <ul>
        <li>What key components when well during the class? What didn't? </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Class Synthesis
      <ul>
        <li>What questions did the students ask?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Start (New, Innovation):</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Tips
        <ul>
          <li>If you did something differently what would it be?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

        <ul>
          <li>What new ideas did you discover?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Stop (What didn&rsquo;t work):</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Traps </li>
      <li>What would not be a good idea to do again?</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Continue (What worked):
      <ul>
        <li>Why did the activities work well? Was it the students, the teacher (presenter), the content, or activity?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Humor
      <ul>
        <li>What was funny about the module? Something you said, students said, etc. that made the class more enjoyable?</li>
