  <h1>Notes for Classroom</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This week is a follow up to Lifecycles, but dealing with the Requirements, Design and Implementation phases specifically, focusing on Functional and Non-functional attributes of Testing characteristics in the process of Verifying and Validating Requirements. Students will implement a test that will address functional and non-functional requirements and design elements. Students will distinguish between validation and verification and learn when to use each. Students will write a System Acceptance Plan and then test it using QA Checklist. </p>
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p>By the end of the week, each student will be able to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Differentiate Functional and Non-Functional  Testing criteria from Requirements, Design and Implementation</li>
    <li>Present a customer report</li>
    <li>Create a Bug Report form</li>
    <li>Complete bug reports for a product</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Before the Week Begins (Prepare)</h2>
  <p>Instructor Resources</p>
  <p>Preparation: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Students will be working on creating a presentation for the customer about features that have been tested. Identifying current issues, and writing bug reports, based on report they created. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Partnership/Group work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Assign partnership different features of <a href="../Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a> or let them pick the features that they want. </li>
    <li>Partnership are also creating Bug Report forms.</li>
    <li>For both assignments, groups of 2-4 can be assigned to work with other group(s) or let it happen dynamically.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Announcement</h2>
  <p><strong>Welcome to Week 11: Verification Validation</strong><br>
This week we will be working on bug reports. After verifying  requirements through testing, defects are sure to abound. A bug needs to be  documented and recorded properly. This is very important. <br>
Some of the hard bugs to fix are very general. For example,  a user reports, &ldquo;The program stopped working.&rdquo; This is not a useful description  of the bug. Or another one, &ldquo;The button doesn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo; Â There is much more information that needs to  be known before it is even close to being solved. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What was the user doing?</li>
    <li>What was running?</li>
    <li>What feature was being used?</li>
    <li>What time of day? (For time-sensitive programs)</li>
    <li>What version of the software is being used?</li>
    <li>What data is being processed?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All this information is needed and should be recorded in a  bug report. <br>
    This week you will be creating a bug report template,  improving on it, and then using it to write five actual bug reports. <br>
    You say, why are we learning to write bug reports? The answer,  to learn what to give back to the project&rsquo;s developer when your test team finds  a bug. Completely unprofessional to tell your project developers, &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t  pass because it stopped working.&rdquo; They will want to know the above information  to know where to start looking. <br>
    There are usually two different types of attributes to testing  the features of a system. The first is the Functional requirements. These are  requirement-based. For example, the computer must connect to the server to get  user information, or a button of a certain size, shape, color, and location is  specified. The second is non-functional. These are requirements of the system  that are a bit harder to test, such a performance, security, legal, portability,  reliability, localization, and usability. Typically non-functional requirements  are those requirements outside the scope of the product but affect the product. <br>
    Verification is testing to make sure that the Functional  Requirements are correct. Does the product do what we said it would do?  Validation is testing to ensure that it what the customer wants, needs, can  use, and will work for all situations or more of the Non-Functional  requirements. Is the product right for the customer? <br>
    System testing is the final set of verification tests after  Unit and Integration tests. Acceptance testing is making sure the customer  understands how the product solved their problem or the Validation. Using Use  Cases helps ensure that the validation process is catching the needs of the  customer. </p>
<h2>During the Week (Teach)</h2>
  <p>Classroom Day 1:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Discuss Verfication and Validation</li>
    <li>Assign Customer Presentation
      <ul>
        
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Classroom Day 2:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Work on Bug Reports.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Classroom Day 3:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>	Customer Presentation (See Lab)</li>
    <li>Review Presentation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Labs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Presentation  to Customer</li>
    <li>Making  sure that the customer gets the right product is just as important as the  product works correctly is all part of Testing. </li>
  </ul>
