    <article>

      <p>This week, the focus will be on different testing tools.</p>

      <h1>Prepare Yourself</h1>
      <p>It is unlikely that any one person utilized every possible testing tool
        during the course of one project or even career.
        It may be worth while to skim over the reading to see which tools
        the students will be exposed to.
        Perhaps the reading will mention one technique which you have not used?
        If so, please spend a bit of time and perhaps research learning more about it.</p>  

      <h1>Activities</h1>

      <h2>Activity: Reading</h2>
      <p>Give each team their testing technique assignment as early as possible.
        A week early is not too early. 
        Certainly, each team should have their assignment by Monday morning.</p>  

      <h2>Activity: Presentation</h2>
      <p>A few teams may ask you to review their slides or check their sources
        as they work on their presentation.
        Try to be prompt in their turn-around.
        Certainly under 24 hours if possible.</p>  
      <p><strong>Online</strong>: 
        Try to grade their submissions as they are posted.
        Thus, if there is a permissions problem with their link
        or if there is a missing component, they can get it fixed before the due-date.</p>
      <p><strong>Campus</strong>: 
        Dedicate the first day of the week to presentation preparation.
        Dedicate the second to the presentations themselves.</p>

      <h2>Activity: Quiz Questions</h2>
      <p>As soon as you receive the quiz questions, 
        copy them into the quiz.
        At the due-date, all of them should be in.
        At that point in time, make the quiz "published."
        You can tell it is published when it has the filled blue dot next to it.</p>  


      <h1>Announcements</h1>
      <p>Post an announcement offering to review their sources, deck, or quiz questions before submitting it.</p>
      <p>Post one or two announcements describing testing techniques you used during your career.
        Again, students love "stories from the trenches;"
        it makes abstract topics seem more real to them.</p>
