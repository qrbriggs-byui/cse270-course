    <article>

      <p>Again, another topic with which you should be well-versed.</p>

      <h1>Prepare Yourself</h1>
      <p>Nothing special is needed this week.</p>  

      <h1>Activities</h1>

      <h2>Activity: Reading</h2>
      <p>The students may ask you questions about their project selection.
        The technology does not matter here (such as the language, the platform, etc.).
        The only thing that is important is that the complexity needs to be "non-trivial."
        A thousand lines of code is a good start, but the larger the project, the better.</p>  

      <h2>Activity: Plan</h2>
      <p>Several teams may have difficulty with identifying a code change.
        You will probably spend most of your time on this part.</p>  
      <p><strong>Online</strong>: 
        Connect with each team individually and offer to review their changes.
        A 5-minute synchronous phone or Zoom meeting might be the most effective way to do this.
        If you cannot schedule a synchronous meeting with a team or two, 
        then encourage that team to share their ideas with you via e-mail.</p>
      <p><strong>Campus</strong>: 
        As with the last two weeks,
        spend the first part of the first day discussing regression testing and answering questions.
        Spend the rest of class time in lab format where you circulate through the room,
        meeting with each team and asking them to show you the draft of their work.</p>
      <p>As with before, get feedback as soon as you can so they can incorporate that feedback
        for their final submission at the end of the week.</p>

      <h2>Activity: Lab</h2>
      <p>As with last week, hold their work to a very high quality bar.
        This should be thoroughly professional.</p>  


      <h1>Announcements</h1>
      <p>An announcement offering to grade their lab early if they submit it early.</p>
      <p>A few announcements talking about regression testing that found subtle or hard-to-find bugs.</p>
