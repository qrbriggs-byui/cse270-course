      <h1>Prepare Yourself</h1>
      <p>Nothing special here.</p>  

      <h1>Activities</h1>

      <h2>Activity: Reading</h2>
      <p>Nothing special here</p>  

      <h2>Activity: Risk Report</h2>
      <p>There will be several questions this week.
        Students may ask what a Military or what a Legal risk may look like.
        In most of these cases, they an answer it by doing some research on the web.
        Do not answer a question that a student can reasonably answer for themselves.
        Students naturally want to be spoon-fed information,
        but they need to be self-sufficient learners.
        Gently and lovingly direct them to resources or paths where they can find their own answers.</p>  
      <p><strong>Online</strong>: 
        As with previous weeks, reach out to the teams individually
        and offer to help them with their questions.
        It would be best if you could meet with each team synchronously.
        If not, then an e-mail exchange will do.</p>
      <p><strong>Campus</strong>: 
        Most of class time will be spend in the lab format
        where the students meet by teams and the teacher circulates among the teams giving them feedback.</p>

      <h2>Activity: Mitigation Report</h2>
      <p>The important thing here is that each mitigation
        demonstrates understanding of the mitigation technique.
        Also each mitigation must be realistic.
        Will it actually reduce the risk?</p>  

      <h1>Announcements</h1>
      <p>How big a role did risk management play in your testing career?
        Perhaps post an announcement describing that.</p>
      <p>Discuss risks to projects that you have worked on.
        These could be risks that manifested themselves in a failed project,
        or ones that were successfully mitigated.
        These could be your own personal projects,
        or projects within your company of which you had a "front row seat."</p>
