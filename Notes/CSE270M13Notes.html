    <article>

      <p>I have worked on teams that were a well-oiled machines.
       I have also worked with a bunch of cowboys.
       The purpose of this lesson is to help students appreciate the benefits
       of working on well-oiled machines and to recognize what
       qualities in a team make it that way.</p>
      <p>Note that we have an entire course on CMM:
        CSE 473 Process Improvement.
        Students who are interested in this or want to learn more
        should be encouraged to take that course.</p>

      <h1>Prepare Yourself</h1>
      <p>If you have not worked with CMM or CMMI,
        you may need to go through the reading carefully.</p>  


      <h2>Activity: Reading</h2>
      <p>Nothing special here</p>  

      <h2>Activity: Draft</h2>
      <p><strong>Online</strong>: 
        As with previous weeks, 
        see if you can meet with each team individually.</p>
      <p><strong>Campus</strong>: 
        Spend the first half of the first class period
        discussing CMM.
        the rest of class time is spent in lab format.</p>
      <p>The grading on this should be turned around as fast as possible
        so the teams have a chance to incorporate your feedback.
        Perhaps offer to grade submissions early if they turn it in before the due-date.

      <h2>Activity: Plan</h2>
      <p>Just grading on this one.
        Look for understanding of the CMM components,
        and evidence that their plan is realistic.</p>  


      <h1>Announcements</h1>
      <p>This is definitely time for a few war stories.
        Some about projects that went terribly bad.
        Some about teams that functioned smoothly.</p>
