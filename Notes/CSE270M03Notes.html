      <h1>CSE 270: W03 Notes</h1>
    </header>
    <article>

      <p>This is not a class about software life-cycle models.
       We do have CSE 272 to cover that topic in greater depth.
       The point of this lesson is to see how to integrate testing services
       into a given development team.
       Since every development team functions a little differently,
       we want to help our students know what questions to ask
       and what kinds of things they will be asked to do.</p>

      <h1>Prepare Yourself</h1>
      <p>Please skim through the reading.
        There is no need to study the reading in depth. 
        The point here is to get a feel for what the students will be reading.</p>  

      <h1>Activities</h1>

      <h2>Activity: Reading</h2>
      <p>Self-grading. No instructor intervention needed here.</p>  

      <h2>Activity: Research</h2>
      <p>Some groups may reach out to you for help on selecting a methodology or finding sources.
        Feel free to advice them or to point them in the right direction,
        but make sure they "own" their selection and their project.</p>  
      <p><strong>Online</strong>: 
        Reach out to each team before the due-date and make yourself available to answer their questions.</p>
      <p><strong>Campus</strong>: 
        During class time, let the students work together to find sources and gather information.
        You might want to circulate through the class, looking over student's shoulders.
        Give them help and answer their questions as needed.
        When more than one group have the same issue,
        then interrupt the class and share the issue with the entire class.</p>
      <p>Try to turn around grading on this item as quickly as you can. 
        It would be best if they have a graded notes submission
        a day before their report is due.</p>

      <h2>Activity: Personal Plan</h2>
      <p>There is no right or wrong answer here.
        The main thing is to get a feeling if the groups have an understanding of the methodology,
        and can visualize how a tester will function within that methodology.
        Of course, look for misconceptions.
        The main thing is to be on the lookout for vagueness 
        that indicates they have not put sufficient thought into the problem.</p>  


      <h1>Announcements</h1>
      <p>Please share with the students the different experiences you have had 
        with different companies or projects.
        What where the common themes?
        What things were different?
        Was their one methodology that you enjoyed the most? Why?
        Stories and specific experiences will help the students visualize
        what life is like embedded in a software development team.</p>
