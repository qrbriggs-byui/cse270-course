    </header>
    <article>

      <p>Though usability studies are usually performed by
        usability engineers, all testers should be able to perform
        a simple usability test.</p>
      <p>Note that many students will have taken or will take CSE 471
        where this will be discussed in much more detail.</p>

      <h1>Prepare Yourself</h1>
      <p>Nothing special this week.</p>  

      <h1>Activities</h1> 

      <h2>Activity: Reading</h2>
      <p>Some teams may need help with their project selection.
        Expect to answer a few e-mails on this topic.</p>  

      <h2>Activity: Plan</h2>
      <p><strong>Online</strong>: 
        As with several earlier weeks,
        reach out to each team individually.
        It would be best if you could arrange a synchronous meeting.
        If not, then answer their questions via e-mail.</p>
      <p><strong>Campus</strong>: 
        The first day, talk about creating a usability test.
        Spend most of the day in lab time where the teams discuss their plans.</p>
      <p><strong>Campus</strong>: 
        The second day, talk about interviewing people and observing.
        Spend most of the day in lab time where the teams refine plans.</p>

      <h2>Activity: Lab</h2>
      <p>Each student needs to conduct their plan with real people.
        Make sure this is done.
        As with previous submissions, hold the students to a high quality bar.</p>  


      <h1>Announcements</h1>
      <p>Two or three stories of usability studies you have conducted or observed.</p>
