      <p>This week, the focus is on automation tools.
        Though I am sure you used different tools in your job,
        our emphasis this week is that the students get hands-on experience
        with <emphasis>some</emphasis> tool.</p>

      <h1>Prepare Yourself</h1>
      <p>You might need to spend an hour or so installing Selenium
       and familiarizing yourself with it.</p>  

      <h1>Activities</h1>

      <h2>Activity: Reading</h2>
      <p>Perhaps pursue the other Selenium pages on this site
        in case you need to refer a team to some of this documentation.</p>  

      <h2>Activity: Lab</h2>
      <p>The vast majority of your time this week will be spent 
        answering student's questions about Selenium.
        Expect to spend a lot of time on e-mail.</p>  
      <p><strong>Online</strong>: 
        Try to be super responsive with their questions on e-mail.</p>
      <p><strong>Campus</strong>: 
        Prepare a quick demonstration in class and have the students follow along.
        Spend the remainder of the class time in a lab format
        where the students work with their partner(s) and you circulate through
        the room answering questions.</p>
      <p>Grading should be super easy.
      Does the screen-shot represent a working solution or not?</p>

      <h2>Activity: Demonstration</h2>
      <p>Watch the video and grade as you go.</p>  


      <h1>Announcements</h1>
      <p>One announcement offering to answer questions.</p>
      <p>Several announcements describing tools you have used
      and/or scripts you have written.</p>
