      <h1>CSE 270: W05 Notes</h1>
    </header>
    <article>

      <p>We will have a complete class on Quality Assurance (CSE 474).
        Our goal here is to help the students see the difference between
        testing and QA.
        We hope also to give the students just a taste of QA.</p>

      <h1>Prepare Yourself</h1>
      <p>Please read the QA article that is part of the reading.
        Many of these components of quality were probably relevant
        in your current job or current project.
        Some, I imagine, were not.
        If there are any that are not, you might want to read them closely
        and perhaps do a little research on the internet
        so you can answer student questions if they were to come up.</p>  
      <p>Install one of the sensor apps on your phone.
        It does not matter which. 
        Spend a few minutes familiarizing yourself with its capabilities.</p>

      <h1>Activities</h1>

      <h2>Activity: Reading</h2>
      <p>Several students may ask you about the various sensor apps.
        Be prepared to tell them about your experience with the one you selected.</p>  

      <h2>Activity: Plan</h2>
      <p><strong>Online</strong>: 
        Reach out to each group on Tuesday or Wednesday.
        Ask them how they are doing with their plan and offer any help.
        Ideally, you will be able to make contact with each group once or twice.</p>
      <p><strong>Campus</strong>: 
        Both days this week are lab days.
        Spend the first part of the first day talking about the quality article
        and answering questions about it.
        The rest of the time, have the students meet by teams.
        Circulate around the class answering questions and offering 
        to look at what they have written at this point.</p>
      <p>For both campus and online students,
        it is very important to grade their plans as soon as possible.
        Give them at least a day for feedback 
        so they can be successful on the Lab due at the end of of the week.</p>
  
      <h2>Activity: Lab</h2>
      <p>The main focus here is that each lab report
        demonstrates that they were methodical and
        their lab itself is professional.</p>  


      <h1>Announcements</h1>
      <p>Tell a few stories about unique or unexpected definitions of quality
      in products you have worked out.</p>
      <p>Offer to grade a groups plan shortly after it is submitted
      so they can have maximal time to incorporate their feedback.</p>
