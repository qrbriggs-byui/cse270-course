    <article>

      <p>This week is all about giving the students some hands-on experience with testing.
        We will learn how to be more rigorous later in the semester.</p>

      <h1>Prepare Yourself</h1>
      <p>Perform the lab yourself.
       Be prepared to answer the student's questions about the lab instructions
       and what they can expect to find.
       These questions are best answered with "When I did this..."</p>  

      <h1>Activities</h1>

      <h2>Activity: Reading</h2>
      <p>There might be some student questions about what constitutes a good source for how their camera works.</p>  

      <h2>Activity: Group Signup</h2>
      <p>Both campus and face-to-face students will need to sign up in groups.</p>  
      <p><strong>Online</strong>: 
        Have the students self-select.
        You might need to reach out to some of the students or even enroll them in a group.
        Make sure the group size is 2-3 students.</p>
      <p><strong>Campus</strong>: 
        This is best done in class.
        Bring up the "People" tab and 
        drag students into various groups.
        Give the students a chance to name their group.</p>

      <h2>Activity: Lab</h2>
      <p>Periodically monitor the discussion board.
        Give students feedback when their post is off topic or of insufficient quality.</p>  


      <h1>Announcements</h1>
      <p>Consider creating an announcement describing your experience with this lab.</p>
      <p>This will be another great time for a "tales from the trenches" story.</p>
