      <p>Weird week were the topic is Verification and Validation,
        but most of the work is in bug reporting.</p>

      <h1>Prepare Yourself</h1>
      <p>None needed this week.</p>  

      <h1>Activities</h1>

      <h2>Activity: Reading</h2>
      <p>No extra work is required on your part</p>  

      <h2>Activity: Defect Selection</h2>
      <p>This app is filled with bugs.
      It should not be difficult for the teams to find several to choose from.</p>  
      <p><strong>Online</strong>:
        Nothing special this week. 
        The students should be self-contained.</p>
      <p><strong>Campus</strong>:
        Spend the first half of the first class period discussing 
        Verification vs. Validation. The second half of class
        in lab time with the students figuring out which defects to report.</p>
      <p><strong>Campus</strong>:
        Spend the first half of the first class period discussing 
        the qualities of good bug reports. 
        The second half of class in lab time where you ask the teams to show drafts of their reports.</p>
      <p>Try to grade their defect selection submission graded as soon as possible.
        The grading load should be light so this should not take very long.</p>

      <h2>Activity: Report</h2>
      <p>As with the last few weeks. hold the students to a very high quality bar.</p>  


      <h1>Announcements</h1>
      <p>Create a lengthy announcement about your take on Verification and Validation.
      Explain the difference in a way that resonated best for you.</p>
      <p>An announcement discussing a defect report that was particularly bad
      and how much extra time/energy it took for the development team.</p>
      <p>An announcement describing the best defect reports you have seen
      or have written yourself. What made it so good?</p>
