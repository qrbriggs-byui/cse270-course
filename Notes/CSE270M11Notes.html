      <h1>CSE 270: W11 Notes</h1>
    </header>
    <article>

      <p>The majority of this week will be a lab re-do opportunity for the students.</p>

      <h1>Prepare Yourself</h1>
      <p>Show students know about architecture testing.</p>  

      <h1>Activities</h1>

      <h2>Activity: Reading</h2>
      <p><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/software-testing-4th/9781466560680/">Software Testing, 4th Edition</a> by Paul C. Jorgensen <br>
Chapter 13: Integration Testing</p>  

      <h2>Activity: Redo</h2>
      <p>This is fairly obvious.
        As a team declares their redo,
        go to that week's assignment and re-grade it.</p>  

      <h1>Announcements</h1>
      <p>One or two stories about integration testing you have done.
        Perhaps your team has special code written or special test harnesses
      to perform this properly?</p>
      <p>As part of the weekly announcement, let students know that they can re-do any assignment for more points or if they like there results, they can work ahead. </p>
