    <article>

      <p>We have three goals this week: 
        1) to get to know the students,
        2) to introduce the students to the fundamental principles of testing,
        3) and to help the students see how testing brings value to the software development process.</p>

      <h1>Prepare Yourself</h1>
      <p>Please follow the student's "Reading" instructions 
        so you can answer their questions as they come up.
        Also, please read the SWEBOK section so you can see what they will be reading.</p>  

      <h1>Activities</h1>

      <h2>Activity: Reading</h2>
      <p>Self grading so no instructor involvement.</p>  

      <h2>Activity: Icebreaker</h2>
      <p>This is an online-only activity</p>  
      <p><strong>Online</strong>: 
        Participate in the discussion board three times a day.
        Try to respond to every post and make a personal connection with the students.
        Share pictures and personal stories.
        They really want to get to know their instructor.</p>
      <p><strong>Campus</strong>: 
        Spend the first day of class going over the structure of the course
        and how grading is done.
        Spend the second day of class (if there is one) helping the students form teams.</p>

      <h2>Activity: Business Case</h2>
      <p>Expect to spend some time answering the student's questions.
        Most of your involvement will be grading.
        Be very detailed in grading this first submission.
        Set the expectation that very high quality work is expected.
        If you allow low quality work this first week,
        then they will provide low quality work for the duration.
        It is much easier to set expectations early.</p>  

      <h1>Announcements</h1>
      <p>Post an announcement before the semester introducing the students to the class.</p>
      <p><strong>Online</strong>Post an announcement on the second day of class encouraging the students to participate 
         in the discussion board.</p>
      <p>Post an announcement describing your industry experience with testing.
         This includes the jobs you had, the projects you worked on, etc.
         Students love to hear these real-world stories.
         It helps them visualize what we are talking about in class.</p>
