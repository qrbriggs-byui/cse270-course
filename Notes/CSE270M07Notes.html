      <p>Test case generation - a core competency for any tester.</p>

      <h1>Prepare Yourself</h1>
      <p>I can't imagine that the chapters in the reading
        could tell you anything about test case generation that you don't already know!</p>  

      <h1>Activities</h1>

      <h2>Activity: Reading</h2>
      <p>No work on your part required here</p>  

      <h2>Activity: Lab</h2>
      <p>As with last week, 
        expect to spend most of your time answering questions about Selenium.</p>  
      <p><strong>Online</strong>: 
        As with last week, try to contact each team and offer individual help on this.</p>
      <p><strong>Campus</strong>: 
        As with last week, spend the first half of the first class period talking about test cases,
        and the rest of the week in lab format.</p>
      <p>Try to grade their assignments as quickly as possible 
        so they have time to incorporate your feedback before their final deliverable.
        Perhaps offer to grade their assignments early if they submit it early 
        so they can have more more.</p>

      <h2>Activity: Demonstration</h2>
      <p>Hold the students to a much higher quality bar this week than before.
        Their work should look professional at this point,
        similar to what you would expect a co-worker to do</p>  


      <h1>Announcements</h1>
      <p>An announcement offering to grade their lab early if they submit it early.</p>
      <p>A few announcements talking about test cases that you have generated in your career
      that found interesting or hard-to-find bugs.</p>
