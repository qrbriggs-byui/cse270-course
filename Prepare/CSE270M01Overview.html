      <p>Software projects often devote insufficient resources to testing because the members of the development team 
        do not place enough value on what testing will do for the project.
        All too often, testing is the last priority and the first thing to get cut.
        To address this  risk, testers often need to make business cases for investing in testing activities.</p>
      <p>While developers and testers often focus on the technical aspects of a project,
        executives and business leaders focus on the financial aspects of a project.
        In other words, they need to make sure a company invests its resources
        in the best possible way.
        One of their primary concerns is the "return on investment (RoI):"
        for each dollar spent, how much can they expect in return?
        To help executives and business leaders make RoI decisions,
        developers and testers prepare business cases.
        A business case is a justification for a proposed project 
        based on anticipated RoI.</p>
      <p>This week, we will learn how testing activities help a technical project become successful.
        We will do this by creating a business case for testing.</p>

      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <p>By the end of the week, each student will be able to:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Explain testing business issues.</li>
        <li>Propose business case for testing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Plan of the Week</h2>
      <p>This week, we will complete the following activities:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Read the syllabus</strong>. 
            Learn what this course is all about, how lessons will be arranged, and how assessment will be performed.</li>
        <li><strong>Introduce yourself</strong>. 
            An important part of the learning process is to socialize with your classmates.
            Get to know them, and let them get to know you.
            A great deal of our classwork this semester will involve working with other members of the class.</li>
        <li><strong>Reading</strong>. 
            All the reading this semester will come from three sources. 
            While we will only use a small amout of this reading in Week 01, we will need to know how to access it.</li>
        <li><strong>Two Articles</strong>.
            On the web, find two articles describing the value testing activities bring to a software project.
            As you read the articles you found, be prepared to answer these questions:
           <ul>
              <li>What is "testing?"</li>
              <li>What is the purpose of testing?</li>
              <li>Why should we test?</li>
           </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Business Case</strong>.
            In a hypothetical scenario,
            make a business case for investing in testing.
            This business case must be based on the two articles previously found.</li>
      </ol>
