      <p>A seasoned tester utilizes various testing techniques during a single software development project. The more techniques a tester has mastered, the more effective they can be. The purpose of this lesson is to learn about several techniques.<br>
      This week, we will receive a testing technique assignment from the course instructor and gather information about your testing technique.</p>
<h2>Quality Assurance Measurements</h2>
      <p>Please read the following article:</p>
      <p class="citation">J. Itkonen et al., &quot;The role of the  tester's knowledge in exploratory software testing,&quot;

      <h2>Testing Technique Assignment</h2>
      <p>Receive from the instructor your team's assignment. If you have not received the assignment by the beginning of the week, you may need to contact him/her directly. Your assignment will be one of the following categories or sub-categories depending on the size of the class:</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
      <p>With your partner(s), find a few sources describing your assigned testing technique. You will need at least four &quot;high-quality&quot; sources.<br>
The majority of your reading will be researching a testing technique. Please work with your partner from last week to research your assigned topic and present it. Find four high-quality sources describing your testing technique. <a href="https://libguides.byui.edu/cs/sources">The BYU-I Library's Guide</a> may help you in this process. The best way to conduct this research is as follows:</p>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li>Start with an initial and      untrustworthy source like Wikipedia. An initial source like this will give      you an overview of the topic and probably not contain too many factual      errors.</li>
        <li>Look at the References and      External Links section of the primary source. These will often refer to a      more trustworthy source you can cite.</li>
        <li>Find keywords and phrases in      the primary source. Search in the Library or for quality sources using      these keywords and phrases.</li>
        <li>Continue this process until      you have found quality sources on all aspects of the topic. You can expect      to read a dozen or so articles until you settle on the half dozen or so      you will need.
