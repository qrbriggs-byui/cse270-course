    <article>
      <p>Testing activities play a significant role in each phase of the software construction process.
        Through the years, many different software construction processes have been developed.
        These processes are called "Software Methodologies" or "Software Development Lifecycle Models."
        This week, we will learn the tester's role in the various software development methodologies.</p>
      <p>The reading for this week consists of three chapters: Life Cycle-Based Testing, The Software Development Process, and Testing Through the Software Lifecycle.
         Additionally, there are two articles to be read.</p>

      <h2>Life Cycle-Based Testing</h2>
      <p>Please open the O'Reilly e-book <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/software-testing-4th/9781466560680/">Software Testing, 4th Edition</a> by Paul C. Jorgensen.

      </ul>
      <p> Note: Many times we have had students mention that some of the reading in the course can be old or too technical. The research papers that we provide are grandfather papers, meaning they are the first published paper on the subject or they are the most comprehensive. The other comment, is that it is too technical, which we inform since all instructors come from and work in the industry, reading technical papers and understanding how to apply it is part of working the profession. If you don't keep up on the published papers, ACM to IEEE magazine, you can find your self quickly out dated. It is the cutting edge stuff, condense and with no fluff. </p>
