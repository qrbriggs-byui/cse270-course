      <p>There are two parts of our reading assignment this week.
        First, you are to find three sources describing how the auto-focus works for your camera.
        Second, you are to visit the Association for Software Testing web site (listed at the bottom of this page).</p>

      <h2>Camera Auto-Focus</h2>
      <p>This week, we are going to test the auto-focus feature for your camera. 
      This will be in a multi-step process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the camera we will test.</li>
        <li>Gather information about how the camera works.</li>
        <li>Create a test plan.</li>
        <li>Conduct the test.</li>
        <li>Report on our findings.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Throughout the course of the semester, we will learn more about each of these steps.
      This week, we will go through the entire process so we can see how all the steps work together.</p>

      <h3>Select a Camera.</h3>
      <p>It does not really matter which camera we use;
        almost all cameras have some sort of auto-focus feature.
        You can use the camera built into your phone,
        or something more advanced if you like (such as a GoPro, DSLR, or any other camera you may have).
        The choice is yours.</p>

      <h3>Gather Information</h3>
      <p>
        Find three sources that describe how the auto-focus feature works for your camera of choice.
        We will be summarizing these sources later in the week.
        Note that your sources should be higher quality than Wikipedia.
        Try to find sources written by acknowledged experts in the field.
        Note that your phone's manufacturer would be an excellent source.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you discover that your camera uses contrast detection
        for auto-focus, then you might need find a source or two 
        to describes what contrast detection means and how it works.
      </p>

      <h3>Create a Test Plan</h3>
      <p>By the end of the week, you will create a test plan describing 
        how you plan to verify that your camera's auto-focus works the way it is supposed to.
        You can learn more about this in the <a href="../Prove/CSE270M02ProveFundamentals.html">Lab Description</a>.</p>

      <h3>Conduct the Test</h3>
      <p>At the end of the week, we will conduct the test plan that you are about to make.
        This will involve actually experimenting with your camera's auto-focus feature.
        Again, you can learn more about this in the <a href="../Prove/CSE270M02ProveFundamentals.html">Lab Description</a>.</p>

      <h3>Report</h3>
      <p>The final part of this week's lab will be to report on your findings.
      In other words, does your camera's auto-focus feature work the way your research said it should?</p>

      <h2>Association for Software Testing</h2>
      <p>There are a large number of organizations devoted to the discipline of software testing.
        One of them is the Association for Software Testing.

      <h2>Video on Writing Testing Cases</h2>
      <p>As a tester you need to know how to write tests. Tests have to be written to the point that anybody can sit down and pick them up and execute the steps. The following video illistrates how lack of providing enough detail, can lead to mis-understand and incorrectly executing the steps. </p>
