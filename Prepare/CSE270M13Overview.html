      <p>To maintain consistency between projects, companies need to establish policies, plans, and procedures applicable to all projects.
        We will learn how to assess the health and quality of a company's procedures this week.
      </p>
      <p>In 1986, the U.S. Department of Defense sponsored a collection of studies to identify the common traits 
        behind successfully managed software projects. 
        The results of this study is called the Capability Maturity Model (CMM).
        The CMM was developed to objectively and systematically determine the quality
        of a software development team's process.
        This week, we will use the CMM framework to identify ways that testing activities
        can assist in the process of moving a project forward.
