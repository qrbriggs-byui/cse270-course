      <h2>Select a Project</h2>
      <p>
        Our lab this week will be to make a code change in a code-base of our choice.
        We are then to determine what parts of the project will be impacted by the code change.
        The final step will be to verify that no other parts of the project were negatively impacted.
        In order to do this, it is necessary to find a code-base that we can work with.
      </p>
      <p>
        With your partner(s), select a code-base of more than a thousand lines of code.
        The choice of language is completely up to you.
        Make sure you and your partner(s) can edit this code-base and recompile the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that it is completely acceptable to use code you have developed for a previous class.
        You may choose to do this because you understand the code better
        than something randomly downloaded from the internet.
