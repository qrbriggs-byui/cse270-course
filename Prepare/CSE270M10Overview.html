      <p>Architecture testing is the process of testing an application system-wide.
        In other words, this is a holistic view of the system
        (as opposed to integration testing or unit testing which focuses on a small sub-set of the system).
        One large component of architecture testing is usability testing.
        This involves evaluating the product from the user's perspective,
        usually by observing representative users interact with the system.
        The focus of our lesson this week will be how to conduct good usability studies.</p>
