      <p>Testers have two essential roles in a software development team.
        First, they need to ensure that the product is built right.
        Second, they need to ensure that the right product is built.
        The former is called verification: ensuring that the product is free of defects.
        The latter is called validation: ensuring that the product meets the client's needs.</p>
      <p>A big part of the verification and validation process is to ensure that defects
        are reported in a consistent and unambiguous manner.
        This is true whether the defect relates to verification or validation.
        In this lesson, we will learn how to create defect reports.</p>

        <li>Explain why bug reporting is an important part of the testing process.</li>
        <li>Create high quality bug reports.</li>
      </ul>
