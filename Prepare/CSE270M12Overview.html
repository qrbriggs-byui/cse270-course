      <p>Testing is a fundamental tool used to prevent project failure.
        One challenge is that project failure can come from many sources.
        In order to provide the greatest possible protection against project failure,
        it is necessary to look at all the potential failure sources.
        Up to this point, we have been focusing on technical failure and usability failure.
        This week, we will learn about other issues which may arise when working on software products.</p>

      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <p>By the end of the week, each student will be able to: </p>

        <li>Appreciate different components of software project risk.</li>
      </ul>
