      <p>Create a video demonstrating your automation.</p>

      <h2>Script</h2>
      <p>Before you create your video, make a plan for what will it contain.
        You may want to consider the following questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What will you say?</li>
        <li>What will be on the screen?</li>
        <li>How long do you expect it to take?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It would be a good idea to run through your script a few times before recording the video.
        The video needs to demonstrate all twelve test cases.</p>

      <h2>Recording</h2>
      <p>Once you are confident you have your script figured out,
        then record it using some type of screen-capture software.
        Your recording must include the faces of all members of the team.
        One of the easiest ways to do this is to record a meeting using Zoom.</p>
      <p>Your recording must be posted online somewhere.
        It could be on YouTube, Loom, or the Zoom servers.
        It is up to you.
        Just make sure that the instructor has permission to view your video.</p>
      <p>The entire video must be no more than one minute in length.
        Please provide a voice-over explaining what is happening in the video.</p>
  
      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>Paste a link to your video in the submission field of the assignment.</p>

      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
      <table class="rubric">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;</th>
            <th>Exceptional<br/>100%</th>
            <th>Good<br/>90%</th>
            <th>Acceptable<br/>70%</th>
            <th>Developing<br/>50%</th>
            <th>Missing<br/>0%</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>12 Tests<br/>50%</th>

            <th>Professionalism<br/>50%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>The video is professional, entertaining to watch, and all the ideas are clearly communicated</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>All aspects of the video is professional</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>Everything is demonstrated. The audio and video quality is high</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>Unprofessional or difficult to watch in any way. This includes a video of over 60 seconds</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>The quality of the video makes it difficult to watch</td>
