      <p>Using Selenium, automate your twelve test cases.
        Create a video demonstrating your automation.</p>

      <h3>Generate Automation</h3>
      <p>Using Selenium, automate your twelve test cases.
        This involves creating twelve individual test scripts.</p>
      <p>As part of your automated tests use assert or verify statements to replace your results or verify statements you wrote in you Test Case Plan. </p>
      <p>Assert statement checks  a variable is an expected value. For results statements use assert...present statements. For example, &quot;assert element present&quot; or &quot;assert selected value&quot;. Assert statements are used to make sure the test has run correctly, if not it stops. As mention in the test case plan, when the expected results does not match the actual results, then the test usually stops, because the follow-on steps will probably not match. </p>
      <p>For verification steps use &quot;verify&quot; or &quot;verify value&quot; if needed. Each automated test must have at least one assert statement the coorelates to verification statement in the Test Case Plan.      </p>
      <h2>Script</h2>
      <p>Before you create your video, make a plan for what will it contain.
        You may want to consider the following questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What will you say? How can you use a narration to make your demonstration more clear?</li>
        <li>What will be on the screen?</li>
        <li>How long do you expect it to take?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It would be a good idea to run through your script a few times before recording the video.
        The video needs to demonstrate all twelve test cases.</p>

      <h2>Recording</h2>
      <p>As with last week, create a script for how you will demonstrate your test cases.
        Record a demonstration of your automation using some type of screen-capture software.
        Your recording must include the faces of all members of the team.
        One of the easiest ways to do this is to record a meeting using Zoom.</p>
      <p>Your recording must be posted online somewhere.
        It could be on YouTube, Loom, or the Zoom servers.
        It is up to you.
        Just make sure that the instructor has permission to view your video.</p>
     <p>The entire video must be no more than one minute in length.
        Please provide a voice-over explaining what is happening in the video.</p>
   
      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>Paste a link to your video in the submission field of the assignment.</p>

      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
      <table class="rubric">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;</th>
            <th>Exceptional<br/>100%</th>
            <th>Good<br/>90%</th>
            <th>Acceptable<br/>70%</th>
            <th>Developing<br/>50%</th>
            <th>Missing<br/>0%</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>12 Tests<br/>50%</th>
<!-- 100 -->
<td>Twelve tests are demonstrated with assert/verify statements</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>At least 6 tests are demonstrated</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>At least two tests are demonstrated</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>At least one test is demonstrated</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>No tests are demonstrated</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Professionalism<br/>50%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>The video is professional, entertaining to watch, and all the ideas are clearly communicated</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>All aspects of the video is professional</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>Everything is demonstrated. The audio and video quality is high</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>Unprofessional or difficult to watch in any way. This includes a video of over 60 seconds</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>The quality of the video makes it difficult to watch</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
