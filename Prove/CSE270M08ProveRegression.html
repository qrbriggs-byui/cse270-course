      <p>Implement your regression test plan and report on the results.</p>

      <h2>Implement the Plan</h2>
      <p>If you received any feedback on your regression test plan,
        please make the necessary changes to ensure it is of sufficient quality.
        Proceeding with a flawed plan is likely to result in flawed results.</p>
      <p>With your partner(s), implement your regression test plan.
        This includes the following activities:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Pre-Test</strong>:
          Conduct all the test cases and report on the results.
          Hopefully, each test will pass.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Change</strong>:
          Make the planned change to the code.
          Note that this must be done after the pre-tests are run.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-Test</strong>:
          Conduct all the test cases again.
        Hopefully, all the tests will pass this time too.</li>
      </ol>
  
      <h2>Report</h2>
      <p>Generate a report recording all that transpired.
        This report must include details of the code change and the result of the test results.</p>

      <h3>Code Changes</h3>
      <p>Present the code before the change and after the change.
        In both cases, only present the code that was changed;
        do not just insert the entire code-base.</p>
      <p>For example, if I were to change a tic-tac-toe board from being a 3x3 array of characters
        to a 3x3 array of integers, I would include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The before and after of the board declaration.</li>
        <li>Any code necessary to convert from a character (in the file format) to an integer (for the new data structure).</li>
        <li>Every instance in the code that referenced the board (both before and after the change was made).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note: if your code change has far-reaching implications
        (such as the tic-tac-toe board which may be referenced a dozen times),
        then the number of test cases may be large.
        In other words, choose your code change carefully!
      </p>

      <h3>Test Cases</h3>
      <p>The report will consist of one section per test case.
        Each section will consist of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The test case details. In most cases, this will be straight from the plan submitted earlier in the week.
          However, if a change in the test case is made, then the updated test case will be presented here.</li>
        <li>The pre-test results.</li>
        <li>The post-test results.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>Your team will submit a single document for your test cases.
        The document needs to be in the PDF format.</p>

      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
      <table class="rubric">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;</th>
            <th>Exceptional<br/>100%</th>
            <th>Good<br/>90%</th>
            <th>Acceptable<br/>70%</th>
            <th>Developing<br/>50%</th>
            <th>Missing<br/>0%</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Code Change<br/>30%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>It is obvious exactly what changed</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>All the required information is present to visualize the code change</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>An important detail is missing</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>Not enough information is present to visualize the code change</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>The code change was not described or the entire code base is dumped in to the report</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Test Cases<br/>60%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>There is no room for improvement in the test cases</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>Each test case is completely described</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>A few minor errors or missing information exists</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>Insufficient detail or insufficient test coverage</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>No test cases are present</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Professionalism<br/>10%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>The report is professional, easy to read, and all the ideas are clearly communicated</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>The writing style is "professional;" there are no grammar, spelling, or formatting errors</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>There exists an instance of a spelling error, grammar error, 
              overly verbose wording, poor formatting, or poor writing</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>Multiple spelling, grammatical, formatting, or writing errors</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>Gross spelling/grammar errors or other aspects of the writing 
              that make the report difficult to read</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
