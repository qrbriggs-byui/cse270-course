    </header>

    <article>
      <p>Looking at all the posts made earlier in the week, 
        what can we learn from them?
        Our final task for the semester is to summarize one type of testing job
        and write a report describing it.</p>
      <p>This report will be completed individually, not with the teams you have worked with previously.</p>

      <h2>Select a Job Title</h2>
      <p>Select a job title that appears more than once in this week's discussion board.
        Find all the reference to that job title and read every summary.</p>
      <p>If you are considering a career in testing,
        it would be best if you selected a job title
        matching the career path you might pursue.</p>

      <h2>Report on the Job</h2>
      <p>Write a report describing the job title you selected.
        Include the range of salaries (minimum, maximum, average, etc.).
        Do the same for educational requirements, certification requirements, and skill requirements.
        What are the duties and responsibilities?</p>

      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>Your report should be about a page in length 
        and summarize all the information gathered from the discussion board.
        The document should be "professionally formatted."
        Make sure the document is fully cited.
        The citation format is up to you;
        the only important thing is that the reader of your paper should be able to find your sources.</p>
      
      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
      <table class="rubric">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;</th>
