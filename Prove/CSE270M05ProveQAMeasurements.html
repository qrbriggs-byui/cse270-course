      <p>The final learning activity of the week will be to carry out 
        the quality plan that was completed earlier in the week.
        You are to then report on the results.</p>

      <h2>Conduct the Quality Plan</h2>
      <p>Using your quality plan, you and your partner(s) are to test as many phones as you can.
        At a minimum, you should test three phones (your phone and your partner(s), and perhaps a friend's phone).</p>
      <p>When you test a phone, take care to carry out each test case as precisely as possible,
        so there is little or no variance between testers.
        If possible, you should also test your partner(s) phone, and he/she should test yours.</p>
      <p>In each case, carefully record everything that transpired during the test.
        A person reading your notes should be able to tell everything that happened during each test.</p>

      <h2>Report on Your Findings</h2>
      <p>When all the tests have been performed, create a report to describe your findings.
        This report should have one section for each requirement.
        Each section must contain the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality Requirement</strong>:
          The quality requirement being tested.</li>
        <li><strong>Citation</strong>:
          A citation linking to any external source pertaining to your requirement.
          State "N/A" for not applicable is no sources were needed for this test case.</li>
        <li><strong>Steps</strong>:
           The steps one must perform to carry out the test.
          These steps must be precise, so anyone can conduct the test the way you envision.</li>
        <li><strong>Variations</strong>:
          If a tester varied from the intended steps, what did he/she do instead? Why?</li>
        <li><strong>Expected Outcome</strong>:
          The expected outcome according to the research.</li>
        <li><strong>Actual Outcome</strong>:
          What actually happened during the test.</li>
        <li><strong>Verdict</strong>:
          Did each test subject meet the requirements? Why or why not?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that half of this information is copied directly from the test plan previously submitted.
        Make sure that any feedback from the previous submission is incorporated in this report.</p>

      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>Your team will submit one document here.
        The document must be in PDF format and professionally formatted.
        Please add an appendix to the document with your raw notes.
        These raw notes do not need to be professionally formatted.</p>

      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
      <table class="rubric">
