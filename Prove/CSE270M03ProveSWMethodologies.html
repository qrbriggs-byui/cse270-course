      <h1>CSE 270: W03 Report: Personal Plan</h1>
    </header>
    <article>
    <p>Recall our hypothetical company from Week 01: H.E.L.P, Inc. 
      This company has adopted the software development methodology that you researched earlier in the week.
      Now, as a new tester on the team, you need to know what you need to do to contribute to the project.
      In other words, you need a plan.</p>

    <h2>Plan</h2>
    <p>With your partner(s), create a plan describing how you will integrate into the development team.
       To create this plan, refer to your research performed earlier in the week.
       Your plan needs to consist of the following items:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Roles: What role will you fulfill? 
        <ul>
          <li>Given that you are a tester, what will be the name of the role or roles you fulfill in the team?</li>
          <li>Describe your responsibilities.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Meetings: What meetings will you (as a tester) be attending?
        <ul>
          <li>Who else will be attending?</li>
          <li>What do you expect the agenda of each meeting to be?</li>
          <li>What will you need to do to prepare for each meeting?</li>
          <li>What will your role be in each meeting?</li>
          <li>What kind of assignments can you expect to receive from each meeting?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Documents: What document(s) will be produced during this process that you (the tester) will read or write?
        <ul>
          <li>What documents will you be expected to produce?</li>
          <li>What documents will you be expected to read?</li>
          <li>Are there any standards governing the format or composition of these documents?</li>
          <li>Are there deadlines or timetables for these documents that you will need to honor?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Checkpoints: What milestones and/or checkpoints are there? For each checkpoint, answer the following questions:
        <ul>
          <li>What is the name of the checkpoint?</li>
          <li>How long (roughly) do you expect it to take to reach this checkpoint?</li>
          <li>How will you know that the checkpoint is reached? This is sometimes called the "exit criteria."</li>
          <li>What is your role in helping the team reach the checkpoint?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>You and your partner(s) will submit a single document representing the plan one tester will follow
      to succeed in H.E.L.P. Inc. using the software development methodology you selected earlier in the semester.
      Please make sure to include citations, using the sources found earlier in the week.
      The document must be "professional."
      You can expect this document to be between two and five pages in length.</p>


      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
      <table class="rubric">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;</th>

              that make the paper difficult to read</td>
