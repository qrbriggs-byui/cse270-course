    <article>
      <p>Our lab this week will be to conduct a usability study 
        utilizing the usability plan previously created.</p>

      <h2>Conduct the Study</h2>
      <p>Each member of the team will interview three people.
        Detailed data from these interviews will be collected and compiled into a single report.</p>
      <p>The combination of all this data should address the question:
        will the average user be able to accomplish the task
        that the feature was designed to facilitate?
        This question should be answered with data collected during the study.
        Make sure that all your conclusions are fully supported by the collected data.</p>

      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>There will be one submission for the entire group.
        This submission will consist of all the data collected during the study,
        and any conclusions that could be drawn.</p>
      <p>The size of your report will vary.
        Most teams will have one page per interview 
        with an additional page to summarize their findings.</p>

      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
      <table class="rubric">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;</th>
            <th>Exceptional<br/>100%</th>
            <th>Good<br/>90%</th>
            <th>Acceptable<br/>70%</th>
            <th>Developing<br/>50%</th>
            <th>Missing<br/>0%</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Data Collection<br/>70%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>Every detail about the interviews was recorded</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>Detailed notes of each interview exists</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>All the required interviews took place</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>Every member of the team conducted at least one interview</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>Usability data is missing</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Conclusion<br/>30%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>The usability study makes a convincing argument of the conclusions it states</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>Product quality conclusions are supported with interview data</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>Conclusions exist and some support exists</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>Conclusions exist but are not supported by data</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>The report contains no conclusions</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
