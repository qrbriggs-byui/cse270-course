      <h1>CSE 270: W12 Report: Risk Mitigation</h1>
    </header>

    <article>
      <p>After we have created a list of the possible risks for a software project,
        the next step is to find ways to minimize their impact. 
        This process is called risk mitigation.
        Out task is to create a risk mitigation plan.</p>

      <h2>Types of Risk Mitigation</h2>
      <p>There are several ways to mitigate a risk: prevention, transference, acceptance, or avoidance.</p>

      <h3>Prevention</h3>
      <p>Prevention mitigation is the process of putting up a defense to prevent it from happening. 
        It could be as simple as fixing a bug.
        It can be as complex as adding technology to make the risk less likely to manifest itself.
        For example, to mitigate the risk of your car being stolen, you could lock at the doors or store it in the locked garage.</p>

      <h3>Transference</h3>
      <p>Transference is the process of having another party assume the risk.
        A typical example is an insurance policy.
        If your car is insured and it is stolen, the insurance company will replace the car.
        This is sometimes called "risk sharing."</p>

      <h3>Acceptance</h3>
      <p>Acceptance is recognizing a risk and deciding to not do anything about it.
        For example, you accept that driving on the highway may cause death or injury.</p>

      <h3>Avoidance</h3>
      <p>Avoidance is the process of changing the activity, process, or policy that introduces the risk.
        This can be as simple as cutting a feature that is known to be risky.
        It can be as complex as changing a technology from one that has a risk to one that does not.
        For example, you can avoid driving at night if you have night vision problems 
        or avoid driving during bad weather if your tires are not new.</p>

      <h2>Risk Mitigation Plan</h2>
      <p>Your assignment is to create a plan for how to mitigate every risk 
        from our risk identification assignment previously submitted.
        Copy your previous submission (making any necessary adjustments from your instructor's feedback)
        and add a new entry in each section: Mitigation.
        Each mitigation item should list the type (prevention, transference, acceptance, or avoidance)
        and details of how the mitigation will occur.</p>
      <p>Note that each risk previously described
        should have a two to five sentence mitigation plan.</p>


      <h2>Submission</h2>
       <p>Your team will submit a single document for your risks.
         The document needs to be in the PDF format.</p>

      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
      <table class="rubric">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;</th>
            <th>Exceptional<br/>100%</th>
            <th>Good<br/>90%</th>
            <th>Acceptable<br/>70%</th>
            <th>Developing<br/>50%</th>
            <th>Missing<br/>0%</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Mitigation List<br/>20%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>Every risk has a mitigation listed</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>90% of the risks are mitigated</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>70% of the risks are mitigated</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>50% of the risks are mitigated</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>None of the risks are mitigated</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Mitigation Quality<br/>60%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>Every risk is mitigated in the best possible way</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>All the mitigations are realistic</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>One or two of the mitigations are not realistic</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>Insufficient information on one or more mitigations</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>None or the mitigations are sufficiently described</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Professionalism<br/>20%</th>
<!-- 100 --><td>The report is professional, easy to read, and all the ideas are clearly communicated</td>
<!-- 90  --><td>The writing style is "professional;" there are no grammar, spelling, or formatting errors</td>
<!-- 70  --><td>There exists an instance of a spelling error, grammar error, overly verbose wording, poor formatting, or poor writing</td>
<!-- 50  --><td>Multiple spelling, grammatical, formatting, or writing errors</td>
<!-- 0   --><td>Gross spelling/grammar errors or other aspects of the writing 
              that make the report difficult to read</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
