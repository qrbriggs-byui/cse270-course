      <p>Create bug reports for each of the five defects you previously selected.</p>

      <h2>Report</h2>
      <p>Based on the bug report template previously submitted, 
        and based on feedback from the instructor,
        create bug reports for each of the five defects you have previously submitted.</p>
      <p>First, locate each defect in the <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse270-course/Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a> application.
        Make sure you fully understand the defect, including how to make the bug manifest itself
        and what the expected behavior should be.</p>
      <p>Next, make sure you understand all the variations in the defect.
        Is there more than one way to make the defect occur?
        Does this defect appear in more than one place in the application?
        Have you selected the minimal number of steps necessary to manifest the defect?</p>
      <p>Finally, fill out the bug template with precision.
        Make sure that all your writings are professional.
        Every piece of information must be presented in an unambiguous way;
        there is nothing extra and nothing missing.</p>

      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>There will be one submission for the entire group.
        This submission will consist of a list of five bug reports.</p>

      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
