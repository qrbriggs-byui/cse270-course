    <article>
      <p>This week, we have the opportunity to redo any lab from the previous ten weeks.
        If there is a grade that you are your partner(s) are not fully satisfied with,
        please take this opportunity to redo that assignment.</p>

      <h3>Notify</h3>
      <p>The first step is to notify your instructor of which lab you would like to redo.
        This is done through e-mail.</p>

      <h3>Redo the Lab</h3>
      <p>After carefully reviewing the feedback from the previous lab with your partner,
        make a plan for how you will improve on it.
        You may need to contact the instructor for clarifying questions.</p>

      <h3>Submit</h3>
      <p>Submit your reworked lab in the location where it was previously submitted.
        Note that this will mark the lab as late.
        When your instructor regrades this assignment, 
        he or she will waive the late penalty.</p>

      <h3>Notify</h3>
      <p>Notify your instructor that the lab was re-submitted.
        When your instructor responds to this e-mail, you will know the lab was regraded.</p>
