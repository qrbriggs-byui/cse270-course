      <h1>CSE 270: W01 Report: Business Case</h1>
    </header>
    <article>
      <p>Team leads, project managers, and executives need to make financial decisions regarding resource allocation.
        It is crucial to spend the right amount of time, resources, and money on various development activities.
        Our job is to create a report detailing the business case for devoting development resources on testing.
        This will be done by researching testing business cases used on other projects,
        and applying that reasoning to a specific case study.</p>

      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      	<p>You just got hired as a tester for H.E.L.P, Inc. 
          This product is in its second release.
          Surprisingly, there was no test team for the first release; the development team did most of the testing.
          The resulting product had poor quality, prompting management to hire a dedicated testing team.</p>
        <p>The first task is to determine how big the testing team needs to be in order to meet the quality targets.
          To build the team you need, you need to justify to management that money spent on the team will be well invested.
          In other words, you need to determine the "return on investment" on the testing costs.
          It would be best if you justified a large enough testing team to get the job done. 
          The best way to do this is to identify the outcomes of an under-budgeted, resource deficient, and time-constrained team.</p>

      <h2>Assignment</h2>
      <p>A business case is a document used to convince a company to fund a new business area.
         Typically the business case document discusses issues/limitations, 
         mitigations/approaches/solutions, and the benefits to a given course of action.</p>
      <p>You will base your business case on research from the internet.
         One good source would be documentation describing business cases
         or how to build a business case.
         There are many good articles out there.
         Another good source would be to find other testing business cases that were previously performed.</p>

      <h3>Business Case Template</h3>
      <p>You will use the following outline to create a business case:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contact Information
          <ul>
            <li>Company: H.E.L.P., Inc.</li>
            <li>Submitted by: &lt;Your Name&gt;</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Reason for the Project
          <ul>
            <li>Start with the backstory and elaborate as you wish.
              In the workplace, you will be able to get this information from your manager when you get assigned to the project.
              For now, we will need to do a little bit of creative writing. 
              No more than a half dozen sentences in a single paragraph.</li>
            <li>Create two scenarios that might happen during software development or the delivery of the software if no additional testing was completed. 
              You should base your scenarios from your research.
              Please cite your response.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Options
          <ul>
            <li>Enumerate three options that management can select from.
              For example, one option might be to have only a single tester on the task. 
              What other options can you think of?
              Each option should consist of a name and a description consisting of a couple sentences,
              based on options discussed in the sources you found in your research.
              Again, please cite your response.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Benefits
            <ul>
              <li>For each option, describe how much it might cost, what the benefits might be, 
                and include a short discussion of the return on investment (is it worth it?).
                This discussion should be based on your research and be properly cited.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Risks
            <ul>
                <li>Identify three or more risks for each option.
                  In other words, what could potentially go wrong if a given option was followed?
                  These risks can be derived from the class material or from your research.</li>
                <li>For each risk, identify possible ways to mitigate them.
                  Some mitigations may be technological (such as testing tools),
                  others might be social (such as specific communication channels).
                  If you drew inspiration from the class material or from your research, make sure to cite.</li>
           </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Recommendation
          <ul>
             <li>For each option, include a short (2-3 sentence) discussion of the pros and cons.
               In other words, if you were to make a choice, what would you do?
               Also include a ranking of the options from the most recommended to the least recommended.</li>
           </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that full credit can be achieved when you exceed the above requirements in some way.
        There are many ways this can be done, such as extra scenarios, options, or risks.
        Another way is to elaborate on the backstory to make the H.E.L.P. Inc. more realistic.
        Finally, incorporating great research is always a way to exceed the requirements.</p>


      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>Upload a single PDF document to I-Learn. 
        This document should be one to three pages and "professionally formatted."
        Make sure the document is fully cited.
        The citation format is up to you;
        the only important thing is that the reader of your paper should be able to find your sources.</p>
      
      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>Your submission will be evaluated according to the following rubric:</p>
      <table class="rubric">
