    </ul>
    <li>Techniques</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Summarize testing techniques (Exploratory,  Domain, Flow,   and   Box) and how they are used in the development to delivery of  a   software   product.</li>

    </ul>
    <li>Cases</li>
    <ul>
      <li>We will demonstrate how to create through  processes how to     create different levels of tests, types of tests approval    (Inspection,   Demo, Sim, Test[Manual or Automated]), techniques to   handle  different   programming principles.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>Also we will be discussing Testing in relation to:</p>

    </ul>
    <li>System Architectures</li>
    <ul>
      <li>We will differentiate different testing needs  for different architectures.</li>
