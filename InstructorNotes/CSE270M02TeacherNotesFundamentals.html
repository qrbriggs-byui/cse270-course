    <li>Students will be creating a brochure (poster, 1-page       flier, or 3-fold handout) about why employees of H.E.L.P., Inc should take       the company's Testing Training. The flier will then be posted on a       professional networking site as part of their Portfolio. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Partnership/Group  work:</h3>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Add/Drop dates are not until the end of the 2nd week,       so to prevent additional work, the partnership will not be assigned until       Week 03.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>During the Week (Teach)</h2>
  <h3>Labs:</h3>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>One of the features of <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse270-course/Labs/DrMobil.html">Dr. Mobile</a> is its ability to gather input quickly. It does this through several       sensors. One of the primary sensors is the camera. The camera needs to be       able to focus quickly.</li>
    <li>Your assignment is to determine three different ways to       test a camera's autofocus and develop a method to determine which type of       focus algorithm and how fast. </li>
    <li>This will be the students' first attempt at creating a       test. The results will be all over the place in format and style. </li>
    <li>Reply to students on how they can improve and run       through a couple of the tests the students publish to see if they work. </li>
